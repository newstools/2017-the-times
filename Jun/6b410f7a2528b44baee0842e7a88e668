McCarthy has been in discussions with City over the role vacated by Eric Tinkler and The Times understands there are just a few loose ends to tie up before his appointment is confirmed.It would be a first head coach role for the 39-year-old, who has previously worked as an assistant at Belgian club Sint Truiden.Club owner John Comitis could not comment on McCarthy's possible appointment yesterday.McCarthy was also unavailable.Comitis last week hinted he was looking for a coach from outside the current crop of Premier Soccer League (PSL) bosses."The new coach will be of the same mind [as Tinkler] in terms of the type of players we have purchased and the way Cape Town City wants to play," he said."The coach we select will pick up the momentum we have created. With the homework I've done, I believe I've possibly found a gem."Comitis and McCarthy are no strangers. The former striker scored three goals in seven starts while on loan to Comitis's Cape Town Spurs in the 1996-1997 PSL season, having previously been with Seven Stars in the First Division.Stars and Spurs later merged to form Ajax Cape Town, though McCarthy had already moved on to Ajax Amsterdam by that time.Just last month McCarthy was in Belfast, Northern Ireland, to attend a Uefa Pro Licence course, the most prestigious coaching programme in world football.He was in the running for the position of Orlando Pirates assistant coach at the start of the 2016-2017 season when, ironically, Tinkler's contract was not renewed.
