Nhlanhla Phangela s body was discovered in a veld between Chiawelo and Phiri on March 1 just hours after she had gone to meet her ex-boyfriend to collect her charger and jacket from his home. She was stabbed twice in the heart in the neck belly button and 22 times on her back said Nhlanhla s uncle Musa Kganyago. Her body was found next to the water tower between Chiawela and Phiri. When I went there the body was moved. The place was full of blood said Kganyago.A 23-year-old man appeared in the Protea Magistrate s Court on Monday in connection with Nhlanhla s death and was released on R6 000 bail. The case was postponed to June 6 for the director of public prosecutions to make a decision on whether to refer the matter to the High Court.All that Kganyago wants is justice for his niece. She was a focused young girl and her future is gone just like that said KganyagoEach of the nine times that he has attended the court case he has had the daunting task of returning to Nhlanhla s mother and father to inform that the case has once again been postponed. We are hurting. I am going to go back home and I have to tell them that it was postponed again today. It kills me. It paralyses the family he said.
