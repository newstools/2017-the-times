The head of the Zion Christian Church Bishop on Sunday likened the country s political leaders to traffic lights saying sometimes they were green sometimes they were red.Delivering his annual Easter sermon at Moria near Polokwane in Limpopo Lekganyane said this year s Easter pilgrimage took place during Freedom Month when there were serious developments in South Africa. The political situation is highly volatile. The economy is also taking a knock. Leaders of political movements are highly divided. They are so unpredictable One day they agree the next day they are sworn enemies. You never get to know where exactly to place them. They are like robots. Sometimes they are green sometimes they are red he said.Saying the ZCC remained neutral and objective he appealed to followers to pray for unity. Stability of this country is of paramount importance. Your ideological differences must not undermine this hard-won freedom. Don t forget that this freedom was not for free. Thousands of people died so that you can be free. I am pleading for matured political engagement. Don t agitate populist rhetoric and political militancy Lekganyane said.The bishop also reiterated the church s opposition to the recent xenophobic violence against our fellow African brothers and sisters . We strongly detest racism and discrimination amongst our people he added.
