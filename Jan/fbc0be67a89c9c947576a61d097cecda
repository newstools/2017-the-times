TshisaLIVE caught up with Danny to get the deets on his plans for the new year.If you make resolutions, tell us your top resolution for 2017I typically don't make resolutions but what I try and do is improve in all aspects of my life- business, health, family and social contribution. As long as I'm doing a bit better than I did last year in all respects, then I am happy.What is your one wish for 2017?My one wish is that my second child, who will be born in May, will be healthy.If you had the power to change the world somehow, what would it be?That every child would have the benefit of an education. An educated mind can achieve anything and too many children in South Africa are deprived of this basic right.Your 2017 in one word will be?Lit!
