Speaking at a somewhat hollow awards ceremony for trophyless Chiefs in Kyalami on Thursday night Motaung said some players who barely featured for Amakhosi in 2016-17 are sure to be shown the door from Naturena. Well it s no secret that we ve got players who in our view we thought were very good and quality players (when Chiefs signed them) Motaung said of Chiefs' flops. But they ended up on the bench and some of them not even on the bench. So sometimes we get it right sometimes we don t get it right. The decisions that we took based on information that we had gathered unfortunately it didn t turn out to be exactly what it was. Unfortunately there are three or four players who really did not do anything did not even play 5% or 10% of the games. So that tells you a story. Motaung said in the off-season Chiefs would have no massive clearout but I m sure those that did not take part at all obviously we ll have to ship them out. One notable player Motaung is likely to be referring to is Zambian striker Lewis Macha who played four league matches without scoring.Asked what needs to change for Chiefs to improve on a fourth-placed finish in the Absa Premiership and a season where Amakhosi did not reach a cup final Motaung said: Well we just have to consolidate and look at the areas where we feel there are gaps. And then be able to address those areas. If we can do that then I think we ll be home and dry. And obviously it doesn t mean that we should just go mad in the market. But we should take the right decisions and get the right skills where we need them. We re not going to be aggressive (in the transfer window). We re going to be in the market of we have to in terms of what we need. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
