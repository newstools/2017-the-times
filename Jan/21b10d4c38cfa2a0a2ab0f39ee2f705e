Speaking to TshisaLIVE outside his manager and cousin, Anele Hlazo's home in Naturena, Tshepo said that he will forever remember Lundi's strength. "We had a lot of challenges during our time, when I was working with him. You will find he's got challenges with media, he's got challenges with drugs, he's got challenges with alcohol, but he was a very strong character and taught me that if you come out, you will get help," he said.
