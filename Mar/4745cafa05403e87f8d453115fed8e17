This after you told her we will screengrab pic.twitter.com/LHznM0Bwk4She later deleted the tweets but the damage had already been done. Actress Rami Chuene saw the messages and took to Twitter to demand an apology from Palesa.Palesa? Really? You had to go there? I'm praying to God you're hacked or drunk! This is unacceptable, unprofessional, un-everything! Tjo! https://t.co/PNjYkG5Iel Rami Chuene 1st Lady (@ramichuene) March 23, 2017Palesa? Really? You had to go there? I'm praying to God you're hacked or drunk! This is unacceptable, unprofessional, un-everything! Tjo! https://t.co/PNjYkG5Iel Irrelevant? Tlala fela? U'll live to regret these tweets which will be munched before u delete. Know u to be of a sound mind. Back off Zola! https://t.co/DmuzkQcAgfHe obviously declined to be interviewed but does that mean u have to attack him like this? U called him irrelevant! U imply he's starving?!? https://t.co/7vP1C9eX9e Rami went on to claim that the only possible explanation for Palesa's tweet was that her account was a parody.The only logical explanation is that we are dealing with a parody account not the real Palesa. I can't. I just can not! Rami Chuene 1st Lady (@ramichuene) March 23, 2017Sadly, that wasn't the case.Gospel star Lebo Sekgobela relives her rape ordeals The only logical explanation is that we are dealing with a parody account not the real Palesa. I can't. I just can not! Palesa's account later tweeted that it was her PR company that had posted the messages about Zola and apologised to the musician.Rami and angry Twitter detectives went after Palesa claiming that she was hiding behind the PR excuse.That's a lie! The apology could have come sooner. The quirky and arrogant responses were too many. None of them are apologetic. https://t.co/6joDTl3QpB Rami Chuene 1st Lady (@ramichuene) March 23, 2017Until I see a real live person, I'm not buying it. An official apology to Zola by boss and her team would be lovely https://t.co/f7O5NE4AL0 Rami Chuene 1st Lady (@ramichuene) March 23, 2017PR Tip: Next time blame it on the wine as per @ramichuene was alluding to. pic.twitter.com/iwjLJMPKP3 Portia Gumede (@portiagumedesa) March 23, 2017That's a lie!
