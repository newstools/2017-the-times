Ntlemeza, he said, had acted unlawfully by arriving at the elite police unit's offices in Silverton, Pretoria."We have been informed that General Ntlemeza entered the management meeting of the Hawks at their headquarters . and he ordered the head of supply chain to give him a car which is roaming around the streets of Pretoria or wherever he is ... And he has got a cellphone of government and state in his possession," said Mbalula. Mbalula's response to a defiant Berning Ntlemeza - in 10 quotesHe said the missing vehicle "must be tracked down and brought back" and a warrant of arrest would be issued if it were not returned.Ntlemeza's lawyer, Comfort Ngidi, told EWN last night he had returned the car and phone.However, Ngidi said his client had done nothing wrong and called on Mbalula not to interfere.Mbalula arrived at the Hawks headquarters shortly after Ntlemeza arrived and convened a media conference. Mbalula: a warrant of arrest should be issued for Ntlemeza"There is no movie here. We are running a country here. That must be clear to Ntlemeza, wherever he is. We are running a country, not a banana republic. At least when I am still here and still minister of police I am not going to allow that nonsense," he said.Mbalula ordered acting national police commissioner Khomotso Phahlane to deal decisively with the drama."I have explained in no uncertain terms to General Phahlane the consequences if he fails to act on Ntlemeza, whether they are friends or not," he added. Ntlemeza back at workNtlemeza reported for work in defiance of a ruling by the Pretoria High Court on April 12 that set aside his appointment as head of the Hawks. This was after earlier court rulings found he lacked honesty and integrity.Mbalula said Ntlemeza was not entitled to report for work even if he did approach the Supreme Court of Appeal to lodge an appeal.
