Motsoeneng was invited by the Gauteng disciplinary committee of the South African Student Congress in partnership with the Young Communist League to deliver a keynote address at the Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) under the theme economic transformation in relation to free education ."Hlaudi Motsoeneng is the father of transformation because he is the one who ensured that transformation is implemented so he is an exemplary of transformation in South Africa " said Katlego Makyobola secretary of the Young Communist League in the region.Turning to the economy Makyobola said the economy is stagnant because of people who are deemed to be qualified but do not have the requisite skills and experience."The reason why we have problems in South Africa and our economy is not transforming is precisely because we rely on people who are educated but at the same time do not have the necessary skills experience and the necessary knowledge to take the county forward " he added.The student who is also part of the student representative council secretary at TUT said it did not matter if one had a qualification or not. If one had leadership skills they should be given a chance to lead.On Wednesday Motsoeneng was invited to address pupils at a school in Ivory Park Midrand but was barred from doing so.He was expected to give a talk at Eqinisweni Secondary School to motivate pupils to focus on their studies.However he blamed the Democratic Alliance for political interference. i"I was invited and if you are invited and there are politics I do not want to be involved ... " he told the Sowetan on Wednesday."The DA is using apartheid tactics. If I am not your role model I am a role model to someone else. If you are not happy then it s your business."
