It was a scrambled goal in a match characterised by some quality finishes and then some horror misses as both sides played out a full-blooded affair that had the fans on the edge of their seat throughout.Moseamedi finished off a flick on fellow substitute Sibusiso Masina to score three minutes into stoppage time after City had led 2-1 at half-time.Aubrey Ngoma and Lebogang Manyama scored two brilliant goals for Cty in the first half but goalkeeping errors from Shu-Aib Walters allowed Chiefs to twice come back through Siphiwe Tshabalala and Joseph Molongoane.City now have a two point lead at the head of the standings but have also played two more matches than Mamelodi Sundowns, who moved up to second. Chiefs have just five games left to keep alive their fading hopes.The full-paced action started almost from the opening whistle as both sides had efforts on goal in the opening six minutes, first Joseph Molongoane for Chiefs and then City s hard-working midfielder Roland Putsche.A free kick after eight minutes was a first opportunity for Putsche to test Chiefs new goalkeeper Brian Bvuma, who replaced the injured Itumeleng Khune. But instead of banging it at the 21-year-old debutant, who must have been full of nerves, Putsche put his effort wide.After that Tshabalala had a driving shot palmed away by City goalkeeper Shu-Aib Walters and the home side should have converted a slick free kick routine after just 13 minutes but Ngoma did not take up Manyama s invitation.But Ngoma more made up for that just three minutes later, picking up the ball some 25 metres out, putting on a burst of acceleration to glide through the Chiefs defence and then chip Bvuma from a tight angle for a sumptuous individual effort.The lead lasted all of four minutes as City made the error of allowing Tshabalala with space and although he had two defenders in front of him, the Chiefs skipper chipped delightfully with his left foot over Walters, who was embarrassingly caught out of position. It was a mark of the experience and intelligence of Tshabalala, who is having a golden couple of months for Chiefs in his new free role in the middle.Manyama almost got through in the 25th minute to stick away Jayiya s cross and then 10 minutes later scored one of the goals of the season, putting the ball through the legs of George Maluleka and then hammering home from an angle to go level with Tendai Ndoro of Orlando Pirates in the goal scoring charts.Chiefs came out of the starting blocks in the second half to dominate and there were sumptuous chances but just Molongoane took up the offer after a square pass from Gustavo Paez in the 72nd minute who pulled the goalkeeper off his line and then easily went around them.Lehlohonolo Majoro and Moseamedi missed two great chances for City while Tshabalala and Paez had opportunities at the other end. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
