The Select Committee on Social Services which was meant to be briefed on the Department s Budget Vote and Annual Performance Plan was cancelled as neither the minister nor her deputy Hendrietta Bogopane-Zulu bothered to show up the DA said.DA spokesperson on social development Bridget Masango said that this follows a trend of Dodging Dlamini s old antics of avoiding vital parliamentary meetings and therefore accountability . Dlamini has previously missed a critical portfolio meeting on 25 January to attend an ANC Legotla in Addis Ababa and a SCOPA meeting on 28 February when she was meant to update Parliament on the South Africa Social Security Agency (SASSA s) and the Department of Social Development s progress in putting in place the distribution of social grants Masango added.According to DA member of the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) Thandi Mpambo-Sibhukwana the select committee was forced to sit and wait for the Minister to show up and the cancellation of the meeting was a waste of precious funds as money had been spent on ensuring other members of the committee were present . It appears that while the Constitutional Court had to rescue the Minister from the social grant crisis earlier this year by extending the contract with Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) it is likely that Dlamini has returned to neglecting her portfolio and instead campaigning for the ANC succession race the DA charged.
