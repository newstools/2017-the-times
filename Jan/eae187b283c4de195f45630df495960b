Zimbabwean media, including New Zimbabwe and Zim News, are reporting that Olinda Chapel took to social media on Thursday to upload an explosive and emotional tell-all video in which she aired her husband's dirty laundry.A video of the Facebook Live rant was shared on several channels on YouTube and went viral in the couple's home country of Zimbabwe. In the lengthy video, a distraught Olinda claimed that her husband had been cheating on her with 19 and 20-year-olds, and that he had brought "his young girlfriends" into their home."I stood by that man. I protected him. I did every single thing for him. I did it from my own hard work," Olinda said, before revealing how she had been told countless times that her husband was an "ass" and that she should leave him.Olinda went on to claim that she has been bankrolling Stunner's lifestyle and had got nothing but pain in return.The video ended with Olinda holding a handful of pills, seemingly threatening to commit suicide by drug overdose."This man wants to destroy my life. You have destroyed me to the last and it's going to end here today. I am tired. I am tired of this man. I am tired," she sobbed, before a friend walked in and interrupted the broadcast.Olinda later returned to social media to backtrack on her claims and said that she was misled."It truly seemed like he was wrong but he wasn't... Des and I are now working on our marriage and we hope God sees us through. I am sorry to everyone who had their time and emotions wasted,"she said in a statement.Stunner made headlines in 2013 after a sex tape of himself with Big Brother Africa contestant Pokello Nare was leaked online.The rapper was nominated for an international African Muzik Magazine Award in 2014 and has toured around the world in his lengthy music career.Stunner has yet to respond to his wife's accusations.
