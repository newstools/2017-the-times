Five things we don t want to see happening in South African Football in 2017:1) Another Bafana Bafana coach losing the plotSomething about that job just seems to turn coaches into a seething ball of rabid frothing-at-the-mouth madness.The examples are plentiful Gordon Igesund Pitso Mosimane and most recently and glaringly.They all start well on the field and a ball of warm fuzzy charm off it.There is often an eight-month timeline for this honeymoon period.A few tough results a hint of criticism even from the fringe charlatan press and they transform into paranoid beings like werewolves from the moonlight sprinting off into the bushveld to hunt rabbits and scratching for fleas with their hind legs.Safa are due to appoint their new Bafana coach in the next few weeks.Hopefully the new incumbent will learn one big important exclamation-mark lesson from the track record of his predecessors don t speak rubbish.2) Charlatans coaching PSL teamsIt s been a bad start to 2017 as already Mark Harrison has been appointed as technical director of last-placed Baroka FC.It s not a coaching job but head coach Kgoloko Thobejane might have to start getting nervous as the term technical director is defined in the popular football lexicon as the coach in waiting .Not that we are casting aspersions on Harrison we wish him and the promoted club all the best in what will be a tough fight surviving their first season in the top-flight.The Englishman though does have a decidedly iffy track record in the PSL coaching Chippa United to relegation being fired in February with Golden Arrows in last place in the year they were relegated in 2014.PSL clubs retreading of flat tyre coaches drags down the strides made by clubs who have made sensible impressive appointments such as Stuart Baxter Gavin Hunt and Pitso Mosimane.3) Ernst Middendorp returning to SA footballReally with reference to the above point about the charlatan coaching treadmill as much as combustible German does have some coaching track record and pedigree his track record of never being able to stay at a club for long must surely now have alerted future employers that Middendorp is not a safe bet.After alienating himself with the powers-that-be in SA football by having to leave Maritzburg United in November because of the public statements he consistently made about acting PSL CEO Mato Madlala Middendorp has secured himself a nice unchallenging job at Bangkok United.He should enjoy the Baht he s earning in a not overly-competitive league the beaches the bars and the safe haven of Thailand.The press especially are tired of the coach s bizarre outbursts every time he picks up his phone for some latest unknown perceived offence.4) Steve Komphela Jesus referencesPlease Steve no. We love your parallels equating football tactics to bikinis but the biblical reference you made after Kaizer Chiefs lost 2-1 against Mamelodi Sundowns had TV interviewer Rob Marawa self-admittedly confused and left the rest of us as in the dark as if there had been an Eskom power cut.5) Clubs playing C teams in continental competitionYes Mamelodi Sundowns have comparably endless player and financial resources.Yes it is expensive.`Yes there is domestic success to be considered first for some clubs especially in the form of league titles.But really if clubs from Uganda can send not just their full-strength teams but also journalists to cover them in the early stages of the Caf Champions League and Confederation Cup - teams from Congo-Brazzaville can regularly reach the group stages and Zesco United from Zambia can reach the semifinals - then surely Bidvest Wits SuperSport United and Platinum Stars with their far greater budgets can do the same.Sundowns are African champions and have led the way. The approach needs to change from other clubs too if SA football is to progress. - TMG Digital
