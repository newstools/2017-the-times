Winning the Absa Premiership s goal of the month for April his second such award this year at the PSL s offices in Parktown on Wednesday Tshabalala deflected attention at one of his best seasons. Thank you for the compliments but for me it s difficult to say that I had a great season or so far I ve achieved accolades whilst the team didn t do well the former Bafana Bafana midfielder said. I m even embarrassed to say that I did well I ve won goal of the month twice. We didn t have a good season."That s what overshadows everything. That s the biggest thing for me to contribute and help the team win at least one trophy."I didn t achieve that so I m very disappointed about that. Responding to what Chiefs legend Tinashe Nengomasha said this week about Tshabalala and central midfielder Willard Katsande standing out as consistently excellent among a sea of mediocrity at Amakhosi Tshabalala said: I think obviously playing for a team of Chiefs calibre expectations are higher. You are required to perform week in week out for a team that is known for winning trophies. And when we don t win trophies yes we will get criticised."And when we win games we will still get criticised. And I think it s how you take criticism."We have to thrive on criticism."Whenever you re being criticised there are always positives to take out of that and it builds you as a person. I personally think that we share it as a collective."It s not tennis it s not golf but football. So it requires everyone s effort and contribution to make it a success. So I cannot point out players and say Player 1 didn t do well Player 2 didn t do well . No. I as a player what did I do to help the other players?"It was not enough. So we didn t do it as a collective hence we have to take the punishment as a team. Tshabalala won goal of the month for his chip from range over goalkeeper Reyaad Pieterse s head in Chiefs 2-2 draw against SuperSport United at Mbombela Stadium on April 29. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
