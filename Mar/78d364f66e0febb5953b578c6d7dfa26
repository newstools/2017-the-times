Mindful of that the Credit Ombud - which resolves complaints from consumers who are negatively impacted by credit bureau information as well consumer disputes with credit providers and their debt collectors - is the only Ombud s office which offers to call consumers back.Consumers get to SMS Help to 44786 and a call centre agent will call them back within a day or at worst two days. That s been the case since late 2015 and it appears to be working.The number of calls handled by the Ombuds call centre has spiked by 32% last year compared with the previous year - that call number includes the SMS call backs. In all 32 000 calls from or to disgruntled consumers were handled during 2016 said Credit Ombud Nicky Lala Mohan at the release of his office s 2016 annual report in Johannesburg on Friday.The office s statistics are impressive from a consumer perspective: 70% of complaints were settled in favour of the consumer - up from 62% the previous year - and that meant a saving of R10.7 million for those consumers. This is an increase of more than 40% on the previous year.Credit Ombud council member Patricia McCracken recounted the story of a domestic worker and single mother of three who attempted suicide over a debt of R8000 which she couldn t seem to pay off. The credit provider had constistently failed to provide her with statements pertaining to her loan.McCracken put her in touch with a Credit Ombud case manager who took up her case at which the credit provider said her last payment of around R1000 was her last - usually a sign that a debtor has overpaid a debt. Three children could have lost their mother over that R1000 McCracken said. This is the human reality behind the statistics revealed here today. The Credit Ombud s office literally saves lives.
