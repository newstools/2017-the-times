The ruling comes after civic body Upper Highway Air which has campaigned to have the dump shut down over a malodour in the area brought the application before the court. They contend that the foul smell has caused respiratory and health issues among residents - a claim which EnviroServ has denied citing an independent report into the stench.Judge Gregory Kruger made the ruling on Tuesday after vehement argument from Enviroserv s legal team. While the company formulates their appeal dumping at the site has been suspended. The time for playing games is over. I am here to protect the community and not the pockets of your client. The buck stops here and it stops today Kruger added.EnviroServ had argued that the halting of dumping at the site would be catastrophic with the build of waste elsewhere but also warned that the noxious smell would get worse. In response Kruger suggested that the company transport the waste to other sites in Johannesburg and Cape Town and continue attempting to treat the smell at the Shongweni site.TMG Digital/TimesLIVE
