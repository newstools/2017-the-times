Letsholonyane helped engineer a second half turn around on Wednesday night as SuperSport bounced back from a goal down to beat Maritzburg United 4-1 and move up to third in the Premier Soccer League standings. He was outstanding again for us said Baxter who made scooping the veteran playmaker away from Kaizer Chiefs one of his main priorities for the 2016-2017 season. Yeye just realises how much he enjoys still being out on the field at his age. But Baxter admitted he would have to try and manage Letsholonyane s playing time to avoid any potential burn out. If you ask him how he is feeling out on the field you know what answer you are going to get. He is always OK and wants to go on."So I have to judge how best to manage him by looking at his statistics. How much running did he do? How many completed passes?"How many power surges up the pitch? That gives me a better idea of whether he is coping or maybe he might need a rest explained Baxter. I ll look at all that and then decided what to do added the coach.Baxter said he might contemplate changes for Saturday night s clash against struggling Highlands Park at Tembisa.Letsholonyane who turns 35 in June has a two-year deal with SuperSport United.He was at Chiefs for eight seasons during which time he won two league titles both under Baxter.Letsholonyane who played first in the Absa Premiership as a substitute with Hellenic in 2004 made his full debut in the league with Jomo Cosmos in August 2006. - TMG Digital
