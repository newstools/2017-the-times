1. No more Kolpak defectors:Abbott and Rossouw joined a list that includes Hardus Viljoen Simon Harmer and Stiaan van Zyl. We could do with a year or 10 of no-one giving up the chance to play for South Africa for a fistful of pounds.2. An International Cricket Council trophy:It s not a World Cup year or a World T20 year but it is a Champions Trophy year. Thing is will it at long last be South Africa s year?3. Bliksim the big three:South Africans won t easily forget their team s test series triumph in Australia last year. The memory would be so much sweeter if they add the scalps of England and India to complete a clean sweep of the Big Three.4. Super selectors: Linda Zondi and his panel had an exceptional 2016 blooding players such as Keshav Maharaj Stephen Cook Andile Phehlukwayo Tabraiz Shamsi and Dwaine Pretorius at international level. Here s to more of their creative thinking.5. Many happy healthy returns:Who knows how AB de Villiers and Dale Steyn are going to fit into the side when they recover from their elbow and shoulder problems but we can only hope they stay healthy for the whole year and more. Injuries must fall. - TMG Digital
