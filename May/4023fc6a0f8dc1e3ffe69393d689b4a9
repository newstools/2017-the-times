In what can be dubbed as an emotionally-charged interview Lolo told eNCA's Checkpoint that she "warned" Karabo about Sandile Mantsoe, who has been arrested allegedly in connection with her murder. "I told her straight 'Karabo, Sandile is going to kill you'. You can't go on like this. This is not a toxic relationship, I don't know what to call it even,'" Lolo said. This after Sandile allegedly beat Karabo so badly she ended up in hospital. Karabo's name topped the Twitter trends list as the backlash against women abuse and femicide was re-ignited.Karabo's mother, who struggled to fight back emotions during the interview, was applauded for her bravery and the strength she showed. The strength that Lolo Mokoena has is unimaginable.#CheckpointThere was nothing anyone cud do to save Karabo. Only this murderer knows what he did to make her not 2leave.fam did all they cud #checkpointStrength to Karabo's mother for being so strong throughout that interview. Wow. #CheckpointHow hard must it be to see your child go through this and not have any recourse???
