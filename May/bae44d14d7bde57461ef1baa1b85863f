Golf Director Kyle Caitano told TMG Digital that a member of staff had called him to the fairway on the 8th hole after spotting the serpent in the open. I saw the python and it went off on its way, he said. We do know that it hangs around near a water source on the course. It is quite rare to see it in the open. He went over the fairway, through a bunker and into the rough, Caitano added.
