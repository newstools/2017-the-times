The popular media personality and entrepreneur will address university students at the Africa Business Club and told TshisaLIVE that he is excited to share his knowledge with delegates."I was invited to be part of a panel of African entrepreneurs and also to give a short presentation on entrepreneurship in Africa. As far as I know, I am the only South African on the panel and so it is up to me to really share the experiences of entrepreneurs in South Africa," DJ Sbu said.Sbu's zealous entrepreneurship efforts with his energy drink MoFaya have often seen the star make headlines for "ambush marketing", and the artist said that he will rely on the experience he has gained from building MoFaya's brand when he addresses the conference."I want them to be inspired by my story. A story about a young man who beat the odds to create and build his own energy drink. I want them to learn from me and see that no matter the challenges that they face, they will always succeed if they are determined enough," DJ Sbu said.DJ Sbu gave a similar presentation at the University of Westminster in London late last year, where he also spoke of his educational outreach programs and bursary fund."Social entrepreneurship is all about giving back and my Sbusiso Leope Education Foundation gives away over 500 bursaries to pupils throughout the country each year. That is something I taught in London and it's something I will teach in Boston," Sbu said.
