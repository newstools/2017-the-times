Rachel is in South Africa to attend the inaugural event of Quest for Non Racial South African Society Dialogue (QfNRSASD) at the Johannesburg Theatre on Wednesday. Speaking on Radio 702 on Tuesday morning, Rachel said that she identified as a black person even though she was biologically born to white parents. The American woman lost her job as a civil rights activist and chapter president for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People after she was outed as a white person.Mzansi reacted with a string of memes and comments over Rachel's belief that she is "trans-black"...Was in the bath listening to the radio. Almost fell out when I heard "trans-Black &amp; cis-Black".
