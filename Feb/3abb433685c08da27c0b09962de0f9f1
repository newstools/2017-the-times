Trevor will perform at the Ticketpro Dome in Johannesburg on August 10 &amp; 11. The show will feature all-new material, and focus on how his life has changed since taking over as host of The Daily Show in America. "I am coming back home to do a show - not because Donald Trump has kicked me out, but because I would like to do a show for you. New jokes, new show, special guests see you there," Trevor said. He also shared the news through a video on the Comedy Central Africa Twitter page.
