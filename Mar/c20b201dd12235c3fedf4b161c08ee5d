Eymael tendered in his resignation from City on Thursday citing personal reasons.The 56-year-old Belgian coach has been announced as the new Bloemfontein Celtic just a day after that decision.With the end of the season only 10 games away Eymael s shock departure has rocked Polokwane City.Eymael is believed to have felt his position had become untenable after his talks with City chairman Johnny Mogaladi to bring Mncwango back into the team collapsed Times Media Digital has learnt.Mncwango was suspended after a 1-1 draw against Maritzburg United in early February over allegations of bringing the club into disrepute. The 29-year-old has missed five matches in all competitions since his suspension on February 9 and has since been training on his own.He was suspended for comments made in the media relating to his reported failed move to Orlando Pirates.Eymael said in radio interviews that he increasingly grew frustrated because he could not use his best player Mncwango who was the club s league top scorer with 13 goals last season second only in the PSL to Mpumalanga Black Aces striker Collins Mbesuma s 14.A well-placed source at the club told Times Media Digital on Friday that Mncwango s suspension was just a tip of the iceberg. The coach confided in the player himself and told him that he is quitting the club because he cannot play his best player the source disclosed. There are various other issues which are really bad for the club and players but which people on the outside do not know. But the unavailability of Thobani was really what broke the camel s back and the coach felt that he had no choice but to resign because since Mncwango s suspension the results haven't been coming through. In the absence of the striker City have huffed and puffed to four consecutive draws (against Highlands Park Ajax Cape Town Orlando Pirates and Baroka FC) and a 3-1 Nedbank Cup last-32 win over third-tier side African All Stars.Mogaladi s phone rang unanswered and he did not respond to text messages sent to him requesting comment on Friday.City are sitting pretty in 7th spot on the Absa Premiership log standings with 26 points from 20 matches. Their next fixture is a trip to Pretoria to face African Champions Mamelodi Sundowns on Tuesday 14 March 2017 Loftus Versfeld Stadium. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
