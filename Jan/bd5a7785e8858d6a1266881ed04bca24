Shut up: that s a question too far.July 6 - Lord s is the venue for the start of the test series against England the first of South Africa s engagements against all of the Big Three countries in the coming months.That s a big enough occasion but there s also this: Dale Steyn s projected return after breaking his shoulder in Perth in November.September 28 - That s when South Africa s home summer starts with a test series against Bangladesh.And in pretty Potchefstroom nogal.Visits by India and Australia are set to complete the schedule but those itineraries have yet to be announced.December 16 - The date for the final of Cricket South Africa s proposed new T20 tournament an eight-team extravaganza touted as being on par with others of its ilk in India Australia the Caribbean Bangladesh Pakistan and England.Can t hardly wait. - TMG Digital
