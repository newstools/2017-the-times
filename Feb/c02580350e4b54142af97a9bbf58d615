Lorenzo Gordinho s goal five minutes before the half time break was enough to see Amakhosi go two points clear of fellow title challengers Bidvest Wits and Cape Town City, although the Soweto giants have played three more matches than the former and one over the latter. The win took Chiefs points tally to 33 points and saw them claim top spot on the log standings albeit on a temporary basis as Wits can regain the leadership of the table with a home win over bottom club and Premier Soccer League new boys Baroka FC on Wednesday.It wasn t overly convincing but it was Chiefs fifth win on the trot, a run that would most certainly please head coach Steve Komphela, who has bizarrely been constantly under pressure despite his team never really falling off the title chase at any stage of the season.It took a set-piece to break the deadlock after an uninspiring first half characterised by few and far in between goal scoring opportunities. Winger Joseph Molongoane and left back Tsepo Masilela had half chances to grab the lead.Masilela should have doubled the lead shortly before the break but the defender failed to hold on to the ball inside the opposition box after being perfectly set up by Molangoane while Franklin Cale had the best opportunity to get on the score sheet for the visitors.Cheifs livewire Siphiwe Tshabalala delivered an inch perfect corner kick aimed at Ramahlwe Mphahlele, who flicked the ball onto the path of Gordinho for the central defender s fourth league of the season to join Tshabalala and Willard Katsande on top of the Chiefs top scorers list.The Lions of the North should have equalised in the 66th minute when Khethukuthula Zwane s firt-time drive forced keeper Itumeleng Khune into a spectacular save. Highlands coach Gordon Igesund has managed just one win in his 13 matches since taking over the reigns in October.Igesund's record now reads seven draws, five defeats and just one win in the 13 matches the former Bafana Bafana coach has overseen since replacing sacked Allan Freese.Highlands remain rooted in second spot from bottom with just 14 points from 18 matches.Igesund s charges are yet to win a match in 2017 following a 3-0 thrashing at Cape Town City in their first match of the year and a 1-1 draw at home to Polokwane City on Sunday. Chiefs will look to continue their winning run when they travel to Ajax Cape Town in their next league encounter of February 25 while Highlands will be at home to title contenders SuperSport United on the same day. - TMG Digital
