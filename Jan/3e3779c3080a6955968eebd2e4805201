The advert for nursing porting and other vacancies claims to come from the hospital s human resources co-ordinator MEC for Health Qedani Mahlangu said in a statement on Friday. When people call the contacts on the advert they are then asked to deposit R2 000 into a retail store in exchange for employment. We want to state firmly that vacancies in the public service are not for sale. Anyone approached for job in exchange for money should report that to the police.
