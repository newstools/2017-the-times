"Our lawyers will get a copy of the judgment today and go through it. Once they have gone through it they will advise us on how to go forward " said SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago."We're very disappointed by the court's decision. We applied for something it wasn't even an appeal. So we will wait and see what our lawyers have to say " Kganyago said.In November last year the court ruled that Motsoeneng's appointment as group executive of corporate affairs - the post he had held previously before he became chief operating officer - was "irrational and unlawful".BusinessLIVE reported earlier on Monday that the court said Motsoeneng could not occupy any position at the SABC until a 2014 report by the public protector was set aside or new disciplinary processes against him were finalised. At the time it described the disciplinary hearing which cleared Motsoeneng of wrongdoing as "wholly inadequate".BusinessLIVE reported that the DA welcomed Tuesday s court decision as a positive step towards restoring the integrity and independence of the SABC. The DA also welcomes the fact that Motsoeneng and his toxic influence will now be removed from the SABC until such time as he has either faced a satisfactory disciplinary hearing and/or the findings and remedial action by the public protector have been reviewed and set aside by another court federal executive chairman James Selfe reportedly said.He said it was time the SABC ceased with its frivolous litigation at the expense of the South African taxpayer and focused on fixing the public broadcaster and correcting the damage Motsoeneng caused.The SABC s lawyer Stephan du Toit argued in court last week that the earlier ruling set a bad precedent as it fundamentally allowed outsiders "to interfere in the employment policies of organs of state".He said the matter needed to be clarified by the Supreme Court of Appeal.Motsoeneng s appointment "constituted an internal arrangement" and not an exercise of public power Du Toit argued.TMG Digital/BusinessLIVE
