The entire leadership of our alliance should be saddened. It s the lowest point in my own history as part of this alliance. I never thought it would come to this Nzimande told reporters. But I don t think we should despair. We should use this as a final wake-up call not for the sake of our organisations but for the sake of our country he continued. Blade Nzimande says this is for him, the lowest point in his history with the alliance. @TimesLIVE #MayDay2017 pic.twitter.com/dwCxbkRw1l Kyle Cowan (@CowansView) May 1, 2017 Blade Nzimande says this is for him, the lowest point in his history with the alliance. @TimesLIVE #MayDay2017 pic.twitter.com/dwCxbkRw1lHe said the leaders of the tri-partite alliance would have to come together to discuss a way forward. We will have to come together and properly analyse this debate and decide what needs to be done. I think as the SACP we are relatively clear on what we think needs to be done he said.Nearly an hour after Zuma left the venue Loch Logan Park groups were still singing some in support of and others against him.TMG Digital/TimesLIVE
