The harrowing cellphone footage, which was taken by passersby, was filmed after his vehicle, a 2014 1.6l EcoBoost Kuga was already burning on the night of 15 December 2015. Jimmy died in the blaze.The footage comes a day after Ford announced a safety recall of the same model in which Jimmy died in. The vehicles to be recalled also include those built between 2012 and 2014.Passersby can be heard screaming for help as others frantically phone the police and flag down motorists. From the footage, it is clear the fire has engulfed the front inside part of Jimmy's car.While police, insurance and private fire and forensic investigators say the fire started from an electrical fault behind the dashboard on the front passenger side of the vehicle, Ford, through its investigators, maintains the fire started at the rear of the car. Ford has, to date, been unable to say what started the fire.What the footage clearly shows as the recording begins is the car's reverse lights coming on. No flames can be seen at the back of the car as it is reversed briefly towards those who are filming.The car's brakelights light up with people screaming that there is someone in the car. The car appears to move forward before eventually coming to a complete stop as the flames spread.
