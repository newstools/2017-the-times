But his lawyers argued the South African Football Association (Safa) knew that Mashaba spoke his mind when it rehired him in September 2014.Mashaba's lawyer Claudio Bollo told the CCMA hearing that he spoke his mind to the media long before 2014."You can't make Mr. Mashaba a diplomat from September 2014 " Bollo said.He said an old dog cannot be taught new tricks.According to Bollo Mashaba worked well with his assistants Thabo Senong and Owen da Gama and there was never any mutiny by players in the Bafana Bafana camp.Safa's first witness and its media officer Matlhomola Morake said Mashaba had been coached to avoid controversial issues during press conferences and interviews but the ex-Orlando Pirates captain did not heed the advice.He said Mashaba even ignored his counsel not to honour an invitation to the Metro FM evening sports show in 2015."The interview was talk of the town " Morake said.Safa's lawyer Mark Thompson showed the hearing a "demeaning" photograph of Mashaba picking his nose under the headline "How Shakes Mashaba succeeded in dousing himself in petrol and setting himself alight".Thompson said it showed how the media had no respect for Mashaba.Morake said relations between the media and Mashaba were "broken and slightly unfixable". - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
