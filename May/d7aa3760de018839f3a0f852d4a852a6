"Vote right, vote ANC. Even the ancestors and angels will love you," the president said.Zuma was not the only political leader out to woo the 81000 voters. The IFP hauled in their battle-hardened leader, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who blamed Zuma for everything from junk status to the cabinet reshuffle, accusing him of being a stubborn president who would not even listen to his party's veterans.EFF leader Julius Malema and DA Western Cape senior member Masizole Mqasela also campaigned in Nquthu yesterday. Zuma was, however, the biggest drawcard."Do not lag behind as Nquthu when the country is progressively moving forward," Zuma told thousands of ANC faithful at the Siyanqoba rally."This is the D-Day to decide your own fate and destiny. Do not be left behind."Zuma, whose campaign followed that of the other ANC top six including Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, national chairman Baleka Mbete, secretary-general Gwede Mantashe, treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize and several other NEC members such as Bheki Cele and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma - said the party had a huge vision for the embattled rural municipality."We are ready to deliver services to this municipality. The ANC is determined and ready to govern Nquthu. We want to work with you and co-operate with you in Nquthu," said Zuma, who spoke in Zulu."If there have been mistakes [we committed] we will rectify them. We will always honour you for voting ANC," said Zuma.The EFF, DA and the NFP are expected to be kingmakers because the council is likely to be governed by a coalition.Fourteen political parties are fielding 325 candidates for 17 wards and 33 seats.Nquthu is one of four local councils in uMzinyathi district municipality. The IFP has Msinga, in Tugela Ferry, and eNdumeni, in Dundee. The ANC controls uMvoti, in Greytown.
