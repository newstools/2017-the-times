Marais was instrumental in setting up four of the Stormers eight tries and he received strong support from the rest of the cast on a day that suggested something special in brewing in Cape Town.The pack typically laid the foundation for victory with locks Pieter-Steph du Toit and Eben Etzebeth also wreaking havoc with the Cheetahs lineout.Marais aside there were strong performances from wing Dillyn Leyds Notshe and new flank Cobus Wiese who enjoyed a strong 55 minutes before he was withdrawn.The Stormers are now 13 points clear at the top of the Africa 1 standings and in perfect shape for their sternest test of the season when they take on the Chiefs at Newlands next week.The rest of the tries came from centre Daniel du Plessis captain Siya Kolisi and flyhalf Robert du Preez while Cheetahs No 8 Henco Venter scored their lone try from a rolling maul.As impressive as the Stormers attack was their defence was also up to the task after a porous display against the Sunwolves in Singapore the previous week.Their spirit was summed up when wing Cheslin Kolbe chased back 60 metres to scythe Henco Venter down inches from the tryline despite the contest being well over with the home side leading 48-10 at the time.Kolbe then broke out from his own 22 to set up Notshe for his hattrick try in the final minute of the match.The Stormers had the match sewn up by halftime thanks to their ability to cut holes in the ragged Cheetahs defence almost at will. Cheetahs coach Franco Smith will have much to ponder this week because it was a performance that had no obvious positive aspects.Marais was excellent in ghosting through the visitors defence one particularly mazy run leading to the team s second try which was finished by No 8 Sikhumbuzo Notzhe.The Stormers have talked about wanting to become a better attacking force and play like the best New Zealand teams and on Saturday s evidence the project is coming along nicely.There were always support runners on the shoulders of ball carriers and even lumbering giants such as lock Eben Etzebeth and tighthead Fran Malherbe are running great angled and supplying deft offloads.Another striking aspect of the Stormers play was the players decision-making and quick thinking.Leyds scored two first half tries and both times he made the decision to back his pace against the covering defence rather than looking for an inside pass.When he was ankle-tapped a couple of metres short of the tryline on his way to his second score he had the presence of mind to release the ball for a split second before picking it up and stretching for the line.It summed up the Stormers display which has given the Newlands faithful reason for genuine optimism in 2017.Scorers: Stormers:Tries: Dillyn Leyds (2) Sikhumbuzo Notshe (3) Daniel du Plessis Robert du Preez Siya Kolisi.
