Thabiso tried to impress the friends and family members of his potential dates with his fancy jargon, evasive answers and big words, but they weren't impressed.The bachelor also failed to win over Twitter users, who tore him to shreds online. They posted hilarious jokes and memes describing how "shady" he was.

Thabiso is shady man #DateMyFamily pic.twitter.com/64Mvq2nc4QOne of Thabiso's potential dates, Mpho was a 25-year-old PhD student. Thabiso said that he was not intimidated by her education. Sadly, Twitter wasn't convinced. Thabiso also got tongues wagging when he told the family of one date that there was nothing wrong with getting married but living separately.
