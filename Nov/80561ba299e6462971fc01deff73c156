Entertainer and musician, Skolopad rocked the Feather Awards red carpet on Thursday night dressed in a clear plastic dress draped in boerewors. Strategically placed, the boerewors covered Skolopad's body parts, and had a tutu sewn onto the back. Instead of a handbag, Skolopad carried a bag of charcoal. Speaking on the red carpet, Skolopad said she wants people to know that she does not like beef referring to the so-called feud between her and Zodwa Wabantu. "I wore it to show that I don't like beef. Wors is easy to braai. And like I have my charcoal, I'm ready to braai after this. The outfit is also to remind people that I am still Queen Skolopad, the original," she told TshisaLIVE. Twitter was shook by the outfit, which saw Skolopad top the trends list and become the talk of the town yet again.
