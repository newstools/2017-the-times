The bad news is that Morkel is only one of half-a-dozen fast bowlers the visitors will take on tour. Morne Morkel has worked hard on his fitness over the past few months and we believe he is now 100% fit and fully able to compete for his place in the team selection convenor Linda Zondi was quoted as saying in a Cricket South Africa release.Perhaps to emphasise his point Zondi added: We have six quality fast bowlers in the squad and that shows just how much of depth the country has in this department. A bulging disc in Morkel s back has kept him out of action for South Africa since June a cruel blow that came in the wake of him successfully stepping into the breach left by the injured Dale Steyn and Vernon Philander.Much has since changed although Steyn is injured again and Philander while officially fit is trying to shake off an ankle problem.Chris Morris made a promising start to his test career in two matches against England last January and Duanne Olivier took the chance he was given in his debut against Sri Lanka at the Wanderers in January.Add Kagiso Rabada and Wayne Parnell to the mix and it s not difficult to see why Morkel s return to the starting XI will not be straightforward.Morris and Parnell have more batting ability than Morkel but he is a more consistent bowler.Morkel s challenge is made more difficult by the fact that he has not played a first-class match since October.That said Morkel s 71 test caps make him exponentially more experienced than Morris Parnell and Olivier who have played eight tests between them.The squad of 13 who did duty in the third test against Sri Lanka in January have been retained with three additions named.They are Morkel Morris and Heinrich Klaasen who fills the vacancy for a reserve wicketkeeper created when Dane Vilas signed a Kolpak deal.Klaasen 25 has 51 first-class caps for Northerns and the Titans.He scored 635 runs at 48.84 with a best effort of 195 in this season s franchise first-class competition.Test squad: Faf du Plessis (captain) Stephen Cook Dean Elgar Hashim Amla JP Duminy Temba Bavuma Quinton de Kock Vernon Philander Keshav Maharaj Wayne Parnell Kagiso Rabada Duanne Olivier Theunis de Bruyn Heinrich Klaasen Morne Morkel Chris Morris.- TMG Digital/TMG Sport
