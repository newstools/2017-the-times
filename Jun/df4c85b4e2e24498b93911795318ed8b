But the Western Cape government has assured residents that water tankers brought in from other municipalities undergo water purification before they are distributed. Knysna is in schedule three water restrictions. We have a massive drought in the Western Cape. But the Akker Kloof dam is at 30%. That is the main reservoir storage facility for the town said Alan Winde MEC for Agriculture Economic Development and Tourism. Then we have the reverse osmosis plants they're up and running and putting water back into the system. The borehole system is also working well and putting water back into the system. Some of the municipality's water infrastructure has been damaged and the electricity needed to run pumps has been cut off.NGOs such as the South African Red Cross said there is a dire need for drinking water in Knysna.Brenton-on-Sea is one suburb where the water was completely cut off.Electricity was provided by generators but there were difficulties with the pumps which are also needed to extract sewage. As for the water situation sure it is under pressure but the trucks are out delivering water they're delivering bottled water that's being trucked in at the moment said Winde.He said that companies like Nestle had large trucks bringing in containers of water. When Nestle brings in a container we also put that into the water system we don't just deliver water out of the tanker just in case so that it runs through the purification plant. He said that there could be discolouration in the water coming from the taps but that it was safe to drink.- TimesLIVE
