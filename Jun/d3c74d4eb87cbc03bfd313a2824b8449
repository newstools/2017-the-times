In its 2017 South Africa Survey the IRR said around 445 835 murders had been recorded in the country between April 1994 and March 2016.This is almost equivalent to the number of people who were killed in the Rwandan genocide between April and July 1994.Despite the alarming figures fewer assassinations are happening now in comparison to the early days of democracy.A total of 25 965 murders were recorded in the 1994/1995 financial year with an average of 71 killings per day.However in 2015/2016 around 51 murders were being reported daily placing the total number of murders in that period at 18 673 a difference of over 7200.The report compiled using statistics issued by the SA Police Service shows that for every 100 000 people in the country in 2015/2016 34 were murdered.The deadliest year for democratic South Africa came in 1995/1996 with 26 877 total killings recorded the IRR survey revealed.But the groups crime analyst Kerwin Lebone said South Africa still holds a significantly higher murder rate in comparison to others countries.The country s murder rate is almost 29 times higher than that of Australia 30 times higher than the United Kingdom and 45 times higher than Germany. South Africans live with horrific levels of violent crime. While the murder rate has fallen since 1994 at 31.9 per 100 000 people it remains one of the highest in the world said Lebone.The survey revealed that murder affects the most vulnerable in society with 884 children murdered between 2015/16.Lebone said South Africa s murder crisis is so serious that some South Africans are more likely to be murdered than the residents of many terror-affected countries.
