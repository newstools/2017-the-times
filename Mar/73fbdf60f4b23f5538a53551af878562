This happened after Mboweni poked fun at receiving royalties ahead of the track's release, and called in EFF leader Julius Malema to start negoations.Malema assured the ex-governor that he would sort it out. A couple of hours later Tito announced victory after Cassper reached out to him.But we guess the real victory was on Cassper's side as shared that the first single of his upcoming album would drop with no hiccups, because he has Tito Mboweni's blessing to release the track.Tito Mboweni is from Cassper's upcoming album Thuto which is dropping on May 7.Hey wena Cassper, how do you produce a song about someone with without negotiating first.
