Night shift workers were effectively locked in Toyota's Prospecton plant after taxi drivers - complaining about the high price of locally manufactured Quantums - blocked roads around the south Durban property. They also blockaded freeways and other main roads throughout Durban largely targeting those that fed onto the N2 which runs past the plant. Workers on the day shift were advised not to come into work.Toyota's Suben Moodley the senior vice president for corporate services confirmed that an entire day's work was halted due to the protest action which ended shortly after a memorandum was handed over at about 11am. Work continued as normal on Thursday."As a result of the protest action Toyota lost one day of production a total of 600 units over two shifts " said Moodley.However the company would not be drawn on the cost implications for the shutdown."Unfortunately we're unable to comment on the cost implications of the protests at this stage " the communications officer said.Meanwhile the DA in KwaZulu-Natal has called on KZN transport MEC Mxolisi Kaunda to facilitate "urgent negotiations" between the provincial government the SA National Taxi Council - which organised the protest - and any other relevant stakeholders.-TMG Digital/TimesLIVE
