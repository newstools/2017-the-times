But the city council has no contingency plan if water runs out.Instead, officials pointed to the Department of Water and Sanitation, which it said was "responsible for consolidated water planning for the region".The city said it had identified 20,000 individuals who used excessive amounts of water and promised to name and shame them, but then backtracked. Cape Town's mayoral committee member for water, Xanthea Limberg, said 212,873 water management devices had been installed in mostly indigent households and were used to restrict water use every day."They may [also] be installed at the homes of some of our highest consumers to help them manage their consumption should they fail to reduce it without assistance," Limberg said.The city had granted 3,350 water restriction exemptions, and 170 had since been revoked, she said.Regional water affairs head Rashid Kahn said although the department was the custodian of water in the province, the municipality had a constitutional mandate to deliver water services. Kahn also said the western parts of Western Cape only had two to three months' water remaining, but the problem was being addressed."We don't call it contingency. We call it top-up or adding water," said Kahn."We are taking water from Bergrivier and putting it into the Voelvlei Dam, and we have ground water systems on stand-by."Limberg said Cape Town was unlikely to run out of usable water before June. "Should we be able to meet the revised collective usage target of 700 million litres per day, current reserves are likely to last for 135 days, by which time we should have experienced significant rainfall," she said.Environmental affairs MEC Anton Bredell told the Cape Town Press Club last week that the coastal city's population growth rate meant water demand would exceed supply by 2019."Given rapid urbanisation and inward migration to Western Cape, we expect an estimated 2million more people to move into the province over the next 15 to 20 years. We must plan and implement now," Bredell said.
