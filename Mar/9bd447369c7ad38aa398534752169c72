The case of a man who killed a debt collector in defence of his mother has sparked heated debate in China, where an appeal court is deciding whether to ratify his life sentence.Social media erupted when Yu Huan was convicted for stabbing to death a man who beat and humiliated his mother.Some web users saw his actions as justified when police failed to step in. Others insisted that "the law is the law" and Yu should serve his full term.Public fury has reached such a fever pitch that the Supreme People's Procuratorate, China's highest investigation agency, has started a rare investigation into the incident.Court documents reveal that Yu Huan's mother, Su Yinxia, borrowed more than one million yuan (R1.8-million) for her auto parts manufacturing company from a local real estate developer.Little by little, she told police, she had paid him back 1.5million yuan. But the 10% monthly interest payments kept taking the debt further out of reach.Developer Wu Xuezhan - who has reportedly been detained by police for connections to organised crime - sent loan collectors to Su's factory in April 2015 and they allegedly abused her.A police officer arrived but, rather than stopping the abuse, issued a mild warning. After he left, a fight erupted. Su insists the debt collectors started it. But Yu finished it, pulling out a fruit knife and stabbing four men, including one who died from blood loss.
