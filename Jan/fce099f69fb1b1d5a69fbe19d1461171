The photograph was posted by the SPCA in Barberton in Mpumalanga with a message stating: THIS is why fireworks need to be banned!!! Everyone who fired fireworks last (Saturday) night this dog died because of you The dog evidently belonged to a policeman who had to work on New Year's Eve.At last look the photo had been shared some 18 000 times and received 754 comments many of which called for fireworks to be banned. Ban fireworks!!!!! Cannot believe they are still going off!!! What is the point!!!!!!!! Seriously this breaks my heart! one Facebook user said. Ban them to hell where they and those who let them off should go. We don't need or want them another message read.Another stated: .. stop making excuses for the selfish actions of those who insist on letting off fireworks ......... this man did his best to safeguard his dog and a dog that size would not ordinarily try to get through that gate/fence in the first place....grown ups acting like kids with no regard for the law or safety of others.... we've tried restricting usage didn't work next step...... BAN FIREWORKS." If u look at the gap between the posts the dog had to REALLY force his way thru. And would have never gotten thru on another day. The solution is simple ban fireworks period said another. It's the people that light the crackers that are the guilty parties! My one dog got an epileptic seizure... and we were home!!! I sat with my dogs in my lap and they were still terrified!!! one Facebook user said.Another Facebook user said: My 2 pitbulls had a huge fight last night because of the fireworks. And in apparent response to criticism that the dog should have been kept in a more secure environment like inside the house the SPCA added: The dog was closed away in a separate area last night and broke out if that too the owner is a police officer who had to work last night!!!
