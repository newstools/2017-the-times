Working at the epicentre of news, photojournalists lead unusual, textured lives. They witness dramatic and important events that readers glimpse only in the frozen form of photos.Alon Skuy, chief photographer at The Times, describes how challenging it is to be exposed to so many different contexts. Often these are disturbing: filming Oscar Pistorius descending to the cells from the courtroom; photographing a bereaved father at the site of his daughter s murder; or shooting a blood-soaked victim of mob justice.His photos are imbued with meaning and questions: students cower in a doorway as a police officer bearing a rifle stalks closer. Radio personality Gareth Cliff and his advocate laugh confidently on their way to court while a man sifts through rubbish in a skip behind them.Capturing these significant split-seconds is an art, as is striking a balance between intimacy and sensitivity. It s trying to find that balance between not being intrusive and being inconspicuous, but also getting to know your subjects, says Skuy, who has won prestigious awards for his powerful work.When asked what he would most like to photograph in the world, Skuy says he is exactly where he wants to be. His purpose is to provide the public with photos of events to which they wouldn t ordinarily have access , and South Africa s transitional nature, marked with political and social turmoil, allows him to create a grand visual record of people and society.
