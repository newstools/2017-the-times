It said that Tshabalala had confirmed what several other witnesses had said to the committee. People like Vuyo Mvoko and Lukhanyo Calata among others also gave the committee such information regarding political interference from the highest office in the land. The only difference is that Tshabalala went further by naming political parties that are directly involved. She mentioned the ANC DA and SACP said COPE spokesman Dennis Bloem. The mere fact that people were appointed at the SABC without the necessary qualifications including Tshabalala and the broadcaster s controversial former chief operating officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng was enough evidence to prove this political interference Bloem added. COPE is looking forward to the written submission from Tshabalala that must be presented to the ad-hoc committee with more information including the names of the politicians who interfered in the operations of the SABC. We believe that if Parliament is serious about cleaning-up the mess at the SABC the committee must insist in getting truthful answers from the political head of the department Minister Faith Muthambi Bloem said.
