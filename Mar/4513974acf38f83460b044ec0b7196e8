Twitter found AKA's tweets a bit suspicious after the rapper choose to tweet one particular line from Cassper's track, accompanied by the laughing face emoji.Cassper and AKA have a history of beef which was only recently squashed, and fans could not help but question the reason behind AKA's tweet. @akaworldwide the way Cassper threaten your entire existence. You always download his songs &amp; come here to diss it.@akaworldwide yaz wena SuperMega u Extra pic.twitter.com/BYzbsX2b2X@akaworldwide Kiernan and spice pic.twitter.com/35Sah5kRmf@akaworldwide "Jump man jump man jump man jump man jump man jump man jump man" lol hahaha we jump till something comes out pic.twitter.com/sbp1fAJEXO@akaworldwide he is the one who started this by his stunt tweets forgive him mega@akaworldwide He showed you respect on the night he achieved his greatest win.
