Fadlu Davids has done an excellent job with the side since taking over in a caretaker capacity from Ernst Middendorp who abruptly resigned in November.But he was never considered for the job full-time with the club stating they wanted to appoint a coach under who he could continue to learn and grow.Top of that list is Roger de Sa who has already been spotted at Maritzburg training late last year.But he is also still holding out to see what develops with the vacant position of Bafana Bafana tactician and is known to be in the running for that post too.Nobody at Maritzburg was prepared to comment on the coaching situation when contacted by Times Media Digital except to say a decision would be taken next week.The club has also engaged with two unnamed foreign-based coaches. - TMG Digital
