Gugu's widow, Letshego accepted an award on his behalf earlier this week, which she described as a huge honour.She and Gugu received the Most Inspirational Couple at the I Do Awards, just days before what would have been their wedding anniversary. Letshego wrote a letter to Gugu which she read out before accepting the award. "I may not get to see you in your physical being, get to touch, kiss or hug you anymore but I do know for sure that you're with me every single day, sitting there quietly by my side, smiling and watching me as I go about my days with our precious angel," she said. Letshego added that Gugu's presence gave her strength. "I still feel your strong presence around me and for me that's enough to wake me up everyday and keep me moving." She thanked Gugu for giving her 15 years of memories that she will treasure forever. A post shared by Letshego Zulu (@letshegozulu) on Feb 19, 2017 at 1:51pm PST
