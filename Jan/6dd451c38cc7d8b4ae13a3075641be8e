Accompanied by American astronaut Shane Kimbrough, the men switched on their spacesuits internal battery power to mark the official start of the spacewalk at 6:22 am, more than a half hour earlier than scheduled.The men's goal for the six-and-a-half hour spacewalk is to finish power maintenance work.This includes connecting several modern lithium-ion batteries -- which weigh about 428 pounds (194 kilograms) each -- to store power for the orbiting lab as it flies in Earth shadow.The work was begun earlier this month during a spacewalk by Kimbrough and American astronaut Peggy Whitson.In all, 12 old nickle hydrogen batteries -- of a total of 48 on board the ISS -- are being replaced with the newer lithium-ion types as part of this month's spacewalks. Eventually, all will be replaced and upgraded.Pesquet, 38, is the fourth French astronaut to perform a spacewalk.He posted pictures of the space station on Facebook Thursday, showing the location of the batteries and the Quest airlock, which is the entry and exit portal for spacewalkers."We will get a closer look of the outside of the space station," he wrote."Peggy says it is even more beautiful when you are out there than looking through the windows."
