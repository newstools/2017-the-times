Tinkler has had a heart-to-heart talk with his players ahead of Tuesday s crunch game against Kaizer Chiefs emphasising the potential of what they could yet achieve. Look it s a tough game and a must-win " he said at a pre-match press conference on Monday."We ve reached that stage of the season now where we having nothing to lose."But we also have to throw everything at it and go for it."We need to be motivated. City go into Tuesday s game with a slender one point lead at the top of the standings and with six games left to play.Tinkler says he and his squad have talked about the longevity of a professional sportsman and the opportunities that arise in a career. Careers at the top of sport are very short eight to 10 years maximum if you are playing at the highest level."The opportunity only comes once in a lifetime and you have to be able to grasp it."Going for a title should push you and motivate you."We had a long discussion around that opportunity you never know it might never come again. We ve got six games left that s a possible 18 points."Yes other clubs like Wits and Sundowns have games in hand on us but I still firmly believe points will be dropped. City will follow Tuesday s clash with Chiefs at the Cape Town Stadium with Maritzburg United (away May 1) Free State Stars (home May 5) SuperSport United (away May 9) Golden Arrows (home May 17) and end the season away at Polokwane City on May 27. What we ve already achieved this season is phenomenal and what is left now is just about us. No one is putting us under any pressure Tinkler added. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
