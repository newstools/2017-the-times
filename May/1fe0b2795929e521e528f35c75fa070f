Gordhan who was axed as finance minister in March led the roasting of the Eskom board and Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown on Tuesday over the reappointment of Brian Molefe.The former finance minister has been referred to as a 'back-bencher' an informal term used to describe a member of parliament who does not serve in the executive and is not a chairperson.Speaking to TimesLive Nonceba Mhlauli acting spokesperson for the office of the Chief Whip in parliament said Gordhan has been deployed to the public enterprises as well as higher education committees.Political analyst Mcebisi Ndletyana said Gordhan taking into account his background was best placed in the public enterprises committee as he has a bird s eye view of all departments and their budgets. The idea is to always place a minister where it is likely to make the most impact and public enterprises aligns with his experience said Ndletyana.He added that Gordhan displayed his decisive and firm role with a passion and moral outrage at the committee meeting showing that he knows what he is talking about.TMG Digital/TimesLIVE
