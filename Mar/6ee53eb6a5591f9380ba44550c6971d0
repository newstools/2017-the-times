Ntsiki, who is never shy to speak her mind, wasted no time in voicing her opinion on the twar between the minister and Robert Marawa.As the spicy exchange between Fikile and Robert unfolded, Ntsiki zoned in hard on Mr Razzmatazz. Robert would make a better minister than u. More sophisticated and respectable https://t.co/PiaDy1aQVXWho is the most childish and uncouth minister? 50marks She even dug out old files and demanded that the minister apologise for insulting her dress sense. I think if Fikile Mbalula wants me to stop tweeting shit about him he BETTER apologize for saying I dress like a prostitute Buffoon https://t.co/1WryUIBJV1@MbalulaFikile @ntlokom I have no "gripe" FYI.I have a different opinion. Different to u trying to get me fired from MetroFM, that's a gripe
