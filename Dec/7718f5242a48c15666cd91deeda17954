A report published briefly on Saturday night on TimesLIVE erroneously said ANC deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa would be the new ANC president. The reporters covering comments made by ANC national chairperson Baleka Mbete misinterpreted her personal endorsement of Ramaphosa as an official party position. The report was removed shortly after being published and we apologise for the error and any confusion it may have caused.
