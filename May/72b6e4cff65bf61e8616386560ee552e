Madikizela confirmed on Tuesday that he had not declared the cake with the Registrar of Members Interests.It was bought by Phumla Zantsi a partner at Lawula Trading and Construction and presented to the MEC at a surprise party held at the One and Only in March shortly after Madikizela was elected acting DA Western Cape leader.Madikizela said he learnt that Zantsi a long-standing friend paid for the cake only when the Sunday Times asked about it.. The only question here is whether among those people (who paid for his party) are people who do business with my department and there isn t a single person beside Phumza he said. Of course now I have to take it up because I didn t have that information. I need to declare that contribution. Madikizela s declaration of interest signed on April 3 only mentions three houses he owns.The ANC has called for the public protector and the Western Cape Legislature conduct committee to probe Madikizela over the party.ANC chief whip said the cake was just a small part of the affair. He can t say it was a surprise party and not declare afterwards because our declarations have to be in in April [and] this surprise party was in March he said.Premier Helen Zille said on Monday she was following due process to establish the facts of the matter. Should further action be required this will be done in line with good governance practices she said in a statement.But Madikizela rubbished the ANC s call for investigations saying there is no story here and that the party was grasping at straws. They have nothing to offer. It s a party in a very sorry state so it s convenient that they can grab anything and make it a story when there is no story at all. But as I said to the premier I have nothing to hide I will cooperate fully he said.
