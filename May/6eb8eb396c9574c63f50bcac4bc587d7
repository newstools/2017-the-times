After dating for about three years Dumi and Simz traditionally tied the knot this past weekend during an intimate family affair. Speaking to Drum magazine Dumi said Simz was sent by "God". "She fell in love with the me I was afraid to become. She was sent by God to pull me to myself, to be a better man than I have ever been. She helps me be the best me I can be. The best thing I ever did was get married to Simphiwe," he told the publication. Dumi is evidently completely besotted with his wife, and even sang her a love song during their wedding celebrations over the weekend.
