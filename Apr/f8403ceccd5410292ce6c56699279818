In his judgment on Monday Mabuse found that the minister had acted irrationally by dissolving the board without giving it a fair hearing. Mabuse set aside Peters' decision to dissolve the board and ordered its reinstatement with immediate effect.He also set aside the appointment of the interim board."The minister exercised her powers arbitrarily or in a greatly unreasonable manner by not giving the members a hearing and simply removing directors of the board."A denial of a fair hearing was clearly designed to cause these concerned directors substantial prejudice."The general rule is that where the Minister entrusted with such powers as envisaged in s 24(1) of the Legal Succession Act is seized with information that seeks her to make a decision the person whose rights or claims may be adversely affected by such a decision is entitled to a hearing."It is one of the fundamental requisites of a fair hearing that she should give such a person an opportunity of meeting such point " Mabuse found.The court noted that the failure by Peters to not provide reasons for her decision to dissolve the board when they were requested by the board created the presumption that her decision was irrational."The minister's explanation of her conduct quite clearly is internally inconsistent and irrational."She terminated on the one hand [former Prasa acting Group Chief Executive Collins] Letsoalo s secondment to Prasa thereby tacitly confirming that there were sound grounds for such termination."...by doing so the minister validated the action of the board to terminate Letsoalo's secondment appointment at Prasa... " Mabuse contended.The court also lashed out at Peters for accepting Letsoalo's version that a dispute had unfolded between him and the board resulting in his sacking and using the "dispute" as a "springboard" to remove the former board from office."These two cannot be married with each other. They demonstrate that the decision to remove the board was irrational " Mabuse found.He found that the minister s decision to remove the concerned directors was "so unreasonable and disproportionate as to be arbitrary and irrational"."The board took a decision to terminate Letsoalo after it had sought and obtained legal advice."The decision to terminate Letsoalo s appointment was thus plainly reasonable given the fact that it had a discretion to terminate his appointment at will."The minister should have accepted the board s decision to terminate Letsoalo's secondment rather than discipline it for it Mabuse ruled."Her decision was accordingly unreasonable on that basis alone."Mabuse said he had reached a conclusion that the former board had proved that they had a clear right to challenge the decision taken by the minister and to have it set aside."The fact that the minister had already appointed a new board... made the matter in my view extremely urgent."The minister was not prepared to wait for her decision to be challenged so that there could be certainty. This shows that she herself thought that the matter was urgent and that a new board had to be installed in order to attend to the governance of PRASA. The court ordered the minister to pay the costs of the application.The department said it is studying the court's decision."We note the outcome of the decision by the court... As the department we are going to study the judgment and we will comment further after we've gone through the substantive matters that relate to the matter " the department's spokesperson Ishmael Mnisi said after the judgment.Mnisi said they will decide on what action to take once they have studied the judgment.The former board was dissolved following the removal of controversial acting CEO Collins Letsoalo who was removed in February after reports revealed he had given himself a 350% salary increase.Popo Molefe who was chairman of the PRASA board claimed he had not been informed of the board s dissolution by Peters and had heard of it through media reports.
