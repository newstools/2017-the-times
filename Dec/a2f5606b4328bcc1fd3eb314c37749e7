As a result‚ traffic authorities have advised motorists heading to Mozambique to use alternative border crossings such as the Mananga/Lomahasha border post. A spokesperson for Trans African Concessions (TRAC)‚ Solange Soares-Nicholson‚ said there were reports that police and traffic authorities had been called in to diffuse the situation when motorists on the N4 toll road near the Lebombo border post had become irate and frustrated‚ resulting in some heated moments.
