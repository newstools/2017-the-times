People all over the world will set an hour aside between 8.30pm and 9.30 pm local time to switch off their non-essential lights and appliances and to make a noise for climate change action.Earth Hour which started in Sydney Australia in 2007 is organised by the World Wide Fund (WWF) as a lights-off event to raise awareness about climate change. Currently more than 162 countries and territories worldwide are part of this initiative which engages a massive mainstream community on a broad range of environmental issues.Power utility Eskom called on South Africans on Saturday to switch off for Earth Hour and said it would be celebrating this hour by using its power to showcase our contribution to South Africa s journey in meeting sustainable development goals . Sustainable development for Eskom includes providing affordable energy and related services by integration and consideration of economic development environmental quality and social equity in business practices in order to continually improve performance and underpin development. As such Eskom strives for sustainable development principles and practices to be entrenched in all of its decisions with the aim of ensuring long-term sustainability. Eskom will measure the savings from this hour inform all South Africans of how much energy was saved in that time and translate that to CO2 savings. Lastly we would like to encourage people to take action beyond the one hour and to make energy efficiency and environmental conservation part of their daily lifestyles. We all know that we need to take immediate action to save our planet but many of us assume that these changes will place an added burden on our pockets and with rising prices on our daily living expenses people don t feel they can contribute. However this is possible. People are encouraged to reduce their energy consumption every day by using electricity efficiently switching off all non-essential lights and appliances the electricity parastatal said in a statement.
