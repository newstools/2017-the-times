 I m a winner either way he told Times Media Digital on Wednesday after proposing to 26-year-old girlfriend Natasha on the pitch at half-time of the match between Cape Town City and AmaKhosi.The pair are both firm Chiefs fans and were in club attire when Matthew and Natasha went out onto the field at halftime. She thought she had won a prize or something he said before pulling out a diamond ring from his pocket and proposing in front of some 20 000.Edged on by radio deejay Ryan O Connor the crowd bellowed at her to say yes . She was shocked but she said yes straight away said Von Meyer 32.He had hatched his plan last week. She was kind of expecting me to propose but probably at the end of the year."We ve been going out for eight years now and I ve already asked her parents permission for her hand."But I always like to surprise her with a stunt or too. I ve been doing it for years on her birthday. Von Meyer contacted Cape Town City last week to ask if he could use the Chiefs match as the backdrop for his proposal.The club s media officer Julian Bailey agreed. I had a good feeling about it from the start. I took the idea to club chairman John Comitis and he liked it too," said Bailey.Permission was successfully sought from the Premier Soccer League and O Connor asked to hype it all up at half-time which he did to good effect while Von Meyer proposed on bended knee.Afterwards the club took the pair out to celebrate even if they weren t happy about their favourite club losing. Matthew and Natasha plan a wedding next June or July. It ll be great if a Chiefs player could come along. Itumeleng Khune is our favourite or Siphiwe Tshabalala. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
