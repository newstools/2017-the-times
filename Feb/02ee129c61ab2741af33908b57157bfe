Maimane challenged the matter in court and it was ruled that an ad hoc committee be set up to probe the matter.Singh said the committee had been established and "we should get a response within the next 30 days".This year Maimane declared a R25 000 cash gift from Alpha a Christian mission organisation in London a R10 000 painting from artist Helene Kapp a painting of himself and Nelson Mandela a revolving pencil holder and three pairs of socks sent on a monthly basis for six months.
