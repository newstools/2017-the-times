After days on edge, not knowing whether she will get a US visa in time to attend the prestigious BET Awards in LA on Sunday, it has been confirmed Babes Wodumo will miss out on the opportunity. It was reported the musician and her manager Mampintsha held a press conference on Friday to address the visa drama that has seen Babes top the trends list for days. A "miscommunication" between officials at the BETs and Babes' record label, West Ink, has been blamed for the confusion. Babes is the only female to be nominated in the Best International Act: Africa category and has been pinning her hopes on walking away with the nod after being left disappointed at local award shows. Despite the popularity of her song, Wololo, Babes has yet to rake in the trophies. She has lambasted South African awards and threatened to boycott them. Her luck hasn't gotten better and she will now be watching the awards from her telly in her lounge.  Khulekani Ntshangase, a spokesperson for the record company, explained that Babes would not make it to the BET due to West Ink having been "committed in a number of activities" after BET informed them to take over in arranging Babes' visa. "As this information came, West Ink was committed in a number of activities which may have resulted in the communiqu√© not transmitted to the management timeously. [Therefore] Babes Wodumo has not traveled to the United States of America for her BET nomination," said West Ink's Khulekani Ntshangase. In a statement, the organisers of the BET Awards, Viacom International Media Networks Africa, said they had been notified about Babes not being able to get a visa and were trying to assist her.
