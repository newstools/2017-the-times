In October this year, Sunday Times Lifestyle conducted a sex survey in association with local research house Ratepop, using their proprietary chatbot technology. This chatbot is a computer program, designed to simulate conversation with human users, and is hosted on Facebook Messenger. As part of the survey, more than 2,000 ordinary South Africans with internet access answered a number of questions about their sex lives. The respondents' identities were kept strictly confidential, but they were segmented into the following demographics: age, sexual orientation, race, location, relationship status and gender. This methodology allowed Ratepop to aggregate the overall results and analyse the data according to these demographic segments. Here are the results: WHO'S HAVING THE MOST SEX? HOW SATISFIED ARE WE WITH OUR SEX LIVES? HOW IMPORTANT IS PENIS SIZE? WHAT DO WE THINK ABOUT DURING SEX? HOW CLUED UP ARE WE ABOUT USING CONDOMS? HERE'S HOW WE DEFINE A SEX DROUGHT: SPEAKING OF MASTURBATION AND PORN ... SEX TOYS: YAE OR NAY? AND BDSM? WHAT ABOUT ANAL SEX? HOW DO WE FEEL ABOUT MONOGAMY? HOW OPEN ARE WE TO INTERRACIAL SEXUAL RELATIONSHIPS? DO WE PAY FOR SEX?
