The Chippa United coach who is a former Buccaneers captain has been linked with the position as furious media speculation over the identity of the new Pirates coach continued unabated since Irvin Khoza said on Monday that the job will be filled within seven days. You don t understand how much pressure I have been under because people have been making like it s a fait accompli that I will be going to Pirates said Malesela after his Chippa side held champions Mamelodi Sundowns to a 1-1 league draw in Mdantsane on Tuesday night. It has been made like it is done and dusted and we are just waiting for somebody to accept the money and I m going and all these things. But Malesela said he knew nothing of the job and was going nowhere. It would be premature for me to go now and leave for any other club and I m leaving these boys here while I m trying to build something. The day that I m forced to leave Chippa will be very sad. The 51-year-old Malesela has been at the Eastern Cape club since December 2015 and last season took Chippa to a top six place and first ever qualification for the MTN8.Chippa are his first club in the top-flight having worked previously only in the National First Division. It is a compliment to me for what what has been achieved over the year. It is good to be wanted and not to be fired! he joked referring to Chippa s notoriously itchy trigger finger with coaches.- TMG Digital/TMG Sport
