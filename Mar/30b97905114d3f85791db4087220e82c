The Black Sash made this submission in its application before the court on Wednesday in light of uncertainty about how the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) is going to pay the grants after the unlawful contract it had with Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) expires on March 31.Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng wanted to find out from Black Sash whether the organisation wanted the court to extend the life of the contract that the court declared invalid a few years ago.Mogoeng said there seemed to be two choices available to the court.One would be that the court ordered Sassa to conclude a new agreement with any party intended to ensure that there was continuity with the payment of grants at the the risk that parties would not agree to the terms. The consequences could be more catastrophic than we have the capacity to imagine Mogoeng said.Mogoeng said the other option was assuming the court had the power to extend the pre-existing illegal contract in the same way as the court did after declaring it invalid. Which of the two options is viable which of them is constitutionally viable? Mogoeng asked.
