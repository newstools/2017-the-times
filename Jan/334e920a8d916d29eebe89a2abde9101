*Disclaimer: This story has a fair amount of speculation. But you decide for yourself.The rumours started shortly after 1 January when Pearl posted a live video to her Instagram account.In the video she was driving in a car and while commenting on the clouds outside, she referred to her man as "husband".Most Twitter detectives have been taking a break to regroup, but die-hard fans picked up on the reference immediately.Had the Quantico star and TV and radio presenter tied-the-knot? Or was she just being casual and referring to Robert as her husband?The video, which is deleted after 24 hours, didn't help the debate.So, what do we know?1) Pearl posted a picture with Robert while in South Africa recently. Next to the image a simple blue heart.A photo posted by Pearl Thusi (@pearlthusi) on Dec 23, 2016 at 12:33am PST2) She's back in New York3) Sources close to the couple say they are planning a "white wedding" later this year.4) Pearl's P.R. team has not responded to questions about getting married.5) Robert told TshisaLIVE that he would not comment on his personal life. "I'm focused on other things right now. I'm not going to comment on that." And then he gave a little laugh.It's not much, but when rumours about their relationship started there wasn't much either. Then we got denials. Then they confirmed an engagement. #justsaying
