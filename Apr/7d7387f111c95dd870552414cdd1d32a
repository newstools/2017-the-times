Somizi's use of 'broken english' at some point in the show had Twitter asking if the choreographer was taking a page out of Penny Penny's book.Combined with his usual flamboyance and extravagant style, his fans agreed that there might be a "relation" between the two reality TV stars. Fans were impressed with the 30-minute show, which they felt needed to be longer based on the entertainment value.Twitter reacted to the "private school" version of Penny Penny:Somizi is another version of Penny Penny who went to private school... #LTDWSomizi#LTDWSomizi did somizi say he is in a relationships pic.twitter.com/0YpNtd5ObWRships are like rental and bonds, if you cnt aford a bond you rent, 3 , 6 mnths you leave until you afford a bond then you bond#LTDWSomizi#LTDWSomizi trying to explain a gay relationship to a child pic.twitter.com/QABC1eQqTU#LTDWSomizi &amp; Papa penny's English are like this pic.twitter.com/ofm720vrUQisn't @somizi like 40 something years old ?
