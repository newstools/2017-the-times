As the year comes to an end, social media users have reflected on the lessons a turbulent and eventful year has taught them, and have plotted a list of things that are best left in 2017. The hilarious list included everything from drawn on eyebrows to political leaders, and showed some of the biggest pet-peeves in SA.

Pearl ThusiÂ was also mentioned for the amount of times she clapped back by dissing her critics' parents. Take a look at some of the most hilarious memes from the trend.
