Seven delegates from the Youth League heckled Cosatu provincial secretary Anele Gxoyiya during his address as they chanted a song that warned him not to declare war when he told ANC delegates that President Jacob Zuma's midnight cabinet reshuffle in March had nothing to do with the ruling party.Gxoyiya had said:" I have no intention of reducing this conference by focusing on an individual. The recent development of a so-called cabinet reshuffle that had nothing to do with the ANC it was counter revolutionary."This triggered an angry response from ANC Youth League delegates who were seated in the middle row at the centre point of the marquee.They shouted "you are factional" while others demanded to know "who are you?".League delegates then proceeded to sing during Gxoyiya's address until they were instructed to stop.Gxoyiya hitting out at the league delegates said: "All delegates must be reminded that the ANC is a broad movement."- TMG Digital/TimesLIVE
