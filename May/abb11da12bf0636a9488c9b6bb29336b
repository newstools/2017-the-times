When people see the police they must see the Messiah Mbalula said.During the parade Mbalula told police members: "Criminals are running amok in this country. Gangsters are running amok they declare war. They have literally seized power they are a state within the state " he said."Somebody said when we were in Elsie's River Minister you are not dealing with ordinary fight against gangsters you are dealing with terrorism. The nation is terrorised he said. Eleven people were injured three youngsters were killed by cold blooded by criminals. This is the nation we are living in. Those people didn't have weapons those kids were playing in the streets those kids wanted to feel safe. There are no-go areas where criminals have taken over they hide weapons under the mattresses they terrorise the nation. They put our people (police) on their payroll so that they are neutralised in reporting crime in their areas " he said.The province will launch the first Cluster Operational Command Centre which aims to consolidate different elements of the police to ensure more efficient policing.The Western Cape government has regularly complained about policing resources in the province.Mbalula said police would "sharpen strategies" based on the "material conditions" of police in the province.TMG Digital/TimesLIVE
