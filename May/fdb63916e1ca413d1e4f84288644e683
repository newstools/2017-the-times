This isn't the first time the Gigabas have had to attempt to stand tall during a tornado of criticism after details of the alleged affair between Malusi and a woman who goes by the name of Buhle Mkhize were leaked.It's also not the first time Buhle and Norma have publically sparred.In 2015 Malusi eventually had to issue a public statement denying the affair and Norma said she would stand by her man.Private messages between Buhle and Norma were then leaked, giving us normal folk a look inside the bitter war of words between them.But, as usual, the Gigabas are presenting a united fromt.They're both in Cape Town and sat down for a spot of sushi at the trendy Balducci restuarant.
