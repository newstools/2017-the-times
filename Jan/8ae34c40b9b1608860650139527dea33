There had been speculation that the national side may begin those qualifiers in March but the Confederation of African Football (Caf) has instead allocated that date for a preliminary round of that competition and does not involve Bafana.The SA Football Association has yet to announce a friendly opponent for the Fifa date in March but they will push hard to find one in order to give the new national team coach the opportunity to take a look at his players in action.It means their first competitive international is due to be in the middle of the year when they start their 2019 Nations Cup qualification campaign away in Nigeria in the week of June 5 to 13.That will be followed immediately by the Cosafa Cup which is scheduled for June 17 to July 2 in North West.Just after the start of the 2017-18 Premier Soccer League season they will face a crucial double-header with Cape Verde Islands in the World Cup qualifiers where a pair of wins could put them firmly in control of the group.Those matches will be played between August 28 and September 5 with Bafana travelling to West Africa first before hosting their opponents.They will have another home game in the Fifa date between October 2 and 10 this time a World Cup qualifier against Burkina Faso.It is possible too that Safa will fit in the Nelson Mandela Challenge for 2017 in that slot. The side will probably be focusing on their away trip to Senegal between November 6 and 14 the final match of their World Cup qualification campaign and the last game of the year.Bafana Bafana fixtures for 2017:March 20-28: Friendly internationalJune 05-13: Nigeria (away)June 14-July 2: Cosafa Cup (home)August 28-September 5: Cape Verde Islands (away and home)October 02-10: Burkina Faso (home)November 06-14: Senegal (away) - TMG Digital
