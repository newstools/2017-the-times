Nthabi Sibanda and her husband were boarding a flight last week to Port Elizabeth to attend a funeral when they clashed with another passenger in an allegedly racial incident.In a video on Twitter this week, the couple address the pilot with their complaint against the man.Jacqueline Rainers, a relative of the couple, retweeted the video identifying Sibanda and her husband."[He] called this gentleman an asshole and when we proceeded to say to him that's unacceptable, he said to me: 'You people are all the same'," Sibanda's husband says in the video.When the pilot attempts to engage the alleged racist, Sibanda interrupts and tells him: "Sir, you are legally obligated to keep us safe. I do not feel safe going into the air with this kind of aggression."The man denied threatening anyone on board, but Sibanda rebutted this, saying: "You called him an asshole. You said I'll bliksem you."The man stood up and said: "We will get out of the way, thank you very much. We will get off the plane," which was met with applause from the other passengers.FlySafair confirmed the incident, which took place at OR Tambo International Airport on Friday afternoon."Our flight captain was called to address passengers who were having an altercation."The passenger and his wife left of their own accord. After their luggage was removed from the hold the aircraft departed normally," said FlySafair spokesman Kirby Gordon.Watch the video below: SOUTH AFRICA my people are standing up for themselves!!!! pic.twitter.com/zA66feqosH
