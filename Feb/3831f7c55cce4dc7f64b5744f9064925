Ajax were forced to play this fixture at the smaller Athlone Stadium as their 55 000-seater Cape Town Stadium was unvailable.The Cape side attempted to take the game to Moses Mabhida Stadium but last minute administrative shortcomings and the Premier Soccer League's refusal to allow the match to take place in Durban left Ajax with no choice but to settle for the 21 500-seater Athlone.Considering that Chiefs last two visits to the Cape Town Stadium have seen crowds averaging 35 000 Ajax were concerned that Athlone would be too small and that lives could be in danger if the game went ahead.But the police have allayed any fears and have confirmed that security personnel has been beefed up for this match. We are ready for the match on Saturday and we are quite confident that all the safety aspects surrounding the match itself will be adhered to said captain Alcock. This game has been classified as medium-risk and not risk-A. However we've had to up our numbers not the police as such but the general security personnel in and around the stadium to match the weight that this fixture carries. It's all systems go added captain Alcock.Ajax Supporter Liaison Officer Thabiso Shooz Mekuto welcomed the readiness of the law enforcement arms but said the club's safety concerns have not completely been allayed. To be honest our concerns around safety and security around this fixture have not gone away completely said Mekuto on Friday. However we have a job to do on Saturday and our job is to make sure that the game goes ahead and finish without any complications. All the law enforcement agencies are ready. Our own security personnel the metro police and the police everybody is ready for this big game.As the club we are confident that our safety and security measures are up to standard and acceptable as per the rules to deal with anything that game has to offer said Mekuto.In the wake of the riot between Orlando Pirates and Mamelodi Sundowns supporters at Loftus Versfeld Stadium in Pretoria two weeks ago extra precautions are being taken for this high profile fixture considering the size of Athlone Stadium.Chiefs are in second place on the Premier Soccer League standing with 33 points from 18 matches while Ajax are struggling in 11th spot with just 19 points.A win for Chiefs will take them two points clear of leaders Bidvest Wits who have played two games less.- TMG Digital/TMG Sport
