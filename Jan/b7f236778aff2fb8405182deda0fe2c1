The 31-year-old has signed a two-year Kolpak contract with midlands county Lancashire alongside legendary West Indian batsman Shivnarine Chanderpaul who has signed as the club's overseas player.Vilas joins the likes of Kyle Abbott Rilee Rossouw Simon Harmer Stiaan van Zyl and Hardus Viljoen as Test players who have struggled to resist the lure of the pound.Vilas made his Test debut against Bangladesh in 2015 and played in six test matches.But like most stumpers in South Africa he's had to play second fiddle to Quinton de Kock's extreme batting and keeping talents.Vilas played the last of his half-dozen Test matches in last year's seven-wicket loss to England at the Wanderers where Stuart Broad's mesmerizing second innings spell razed the Proteas and delivered the series to the visitors.Vilas has taken part in 96 first-class matches having collected 7580 runs at an average of just under 40.He will be joining the Red Roses in March and newly appointed head coach Glen Chapple said Vilas is an excellent acquisition for the club.Chanderpaul and Vilas are replacements for former South African Test players Ashwell Prince and Alviro Petersen.The former retired became a national selector and moved into coaching while the latter is serving a ban for match-fixing. Signing a player of Dane s undoubted calibre and experience is a great boost as we continue our preparations ahead of the new season."He has an excellent record in First Class cricket and is a very good wicket keeper."Dane s aggressive batting style will see him as an important part of our T20 and one-day sides in 2017 as well as four day cricket Chapple said on the club's website. - TMG Digital
