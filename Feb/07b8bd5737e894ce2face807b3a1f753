The Johannesburg Metro Police Department s K9 Unit on Friday cracked down on two major drug suppliers in Turffontein who were also believed to be supplying to surrounding neighbourhoods which included the much troubled Rosettenville community Gauteng MEC for Safety Michael Sun said.He said a 33-year-old female suspect was arrested in Tully Street and a 52-year-old male suspect was arrested in Church Street for possession of cannabis. 27 kilograms of the illicit drug with an estimated value of more than R35 000 plus R9 000 in cash were seized from the two suspects. The successful arrests are the result of a silent operation during which the JMPD K9 Unit monitored the suspects over a period of days. The suspects were taken to the Booysens Police Station and charged for possession and dealing of drugs Sun said. In a separate operation on Friday the K9 Unit had also arrested a 34-year-old male in the Roodepoort CBD for possession and dealing of drugs he said. The suspect was taken to the Roodepoort Police Station for further processing. I commend the officers of JMPD for their tireless effort to ensure that criminals cannot rest in the City of Johannesburg. It is important that we not only crack down on the street dealers but also get to the big suppliers who are responsible for a thriving underworld of drug dealing within the City. Lawlessness has been ignored for too long and there is no quick fix to address these problems. However the City will not hesitate in our efforts to fight crime Sun said on Saturday. We remain committed to ensuring that we drive criminals from our neighbourhoods and make problem areas such as Turffontein Rosettenville and Roodepoort a safer place for our residents to live work and play he added.
