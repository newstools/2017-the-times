The grandson of former president Nelson Mandela on Monday morning posted a picture of two positive home pregnancy tests showing two bright pink lines.The image was captioned ALHAMDULILLAH which is a saying used by Muslims to express praise to God.This was followed on Monday afternoon with a statement issued with their traditional Mvezo titles - Nkosi Zwelivelile and Nkosikazi Nosekeni Rabia Mandela."We are excited beyond words today to be celebrating not only our first wedding anniversary but also the fact that we are expecting our first bundle of joy (in transit) " they said using emoticons to describe their love."Mvezo Komkhulu will once again experience the pitter-patter of a young Mandela's feet."It's been an amazing year. We are truly blessed and very grateful for all the well-wishes received."Mandela married Muslim bride Rabia Clarke in Cape Town in February 2016 after which she adopted a traditional name when she was welcomed by the AbaThembu community in Mvezo. At the time of their wedding Mandela said: Although Rabia and I were raised in different cultural and religious traditions our coming together reflects what we have in common: We are South Africans. The marriage was the fourth for Mandela. He was still legally married to his first wife Tando Mabunu-Mandela although they are estranged and embroiled in bitter court battles. Mandela s second and third marriages were annulled.
