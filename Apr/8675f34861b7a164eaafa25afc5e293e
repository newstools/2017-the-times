The hip-hop reality show's season two debuted last night and music fans were blown away by the talent, but also had questions about the 'female representation' on the panel.The show has Khuli Chana AKA and Stogie T on the panel with Siyabonga 'Scoop' Ngwekazi as the presenter.Despite the growing criticism, Vuzu has remained firm in its selection of judges, insisting that the panel is selected on merit and not gender."Our three judges were selected based on their long and illustrious track records and numerous successes in the hip hop industry, not on their genders. Since season one, the three judges we have developed a major following and association to the show," said Vuzu's Nondumiso Mabece.The criticism grew after a female hip-hop hopeful was told by judges on the show that she did not have the right "image." Fans immediately questioned why her image was critiqued instead of her ability. I feel like #VuzuHustle needs a female MC judge. These guys judging female rappers on how they look pic.twitter.com/Lnj4INCW95Didn't hear the guys being told to work on their look. An ill female mc comes through and that's the first comment she gets #VuzuHustleI don't think any of these guys that appeared were wearing any better than that girl. So why single her out? Female Judge pls. #VuzuHustleVuzu maintains that there has been no bias and that there is an "amazing line-up of female guest judges throughout the season."
