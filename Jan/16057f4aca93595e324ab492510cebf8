This effectively signals the end of Domingo's four-year tenure as the Proteas head coach.Domingo's contract expires at the end of August which coincides with the end of South Africa's two and a half-month tour to England.The tour starts in mid-May and ends after the fourth test at Old Trafford in Manchester on August 8.Domingo's contract was due to expire in April this year but an impressive mid-year performance in 2016 - South Africa beat New Zealand 1-0 in a two-test series and whitewashed Australia 5-0 in an ODI series - played a significant role in his contract extension.CSA spokesperson Altaaf Kazi said Domingo can also re-apply for his current job. Russell's contract has only been extended until the end of the England series " Kazi said. "Since his contract has been extended until the end of the England series we've started the processes of looking for and confirming the Proteas coach from post the England series to the post the 2019 Cricket World Cup."CSA also resolved to retain the six-team franchise system rubbishing ideas that two more franchises were to be added to the current South African first class system.The members council accepted the board of directors' recommendation at a meeting that took place on Saturday.Last year there were rumours of CSA adding two more franchises to the existing six with Border North-West and Northern Cape (formerly Griquas) in the running to alleviate a player bottleneck and transformation issues.Currently CSA's six franchise sides have divvied up the 13 affiliates with the Cape Cobras (Western Province Boland and South-Western Districts) Warriors (Eastern Province and Border) Dolphins(KwaZulu-Natal coastal and KwaZulu-Natal Inland) Knights (Free State and Northern Cape Titans (Northerns and Easterns) and the Highveld Lions (Gauteng Strikers and North-West) each holding up the respective cricketing regions.Northern Cape and Border were the front runners for the respective franchises because of being the hotbeds of Black African and coloured cricket.North-West was sounded out because of its close proximity to Johannesburg and it's excellent sporting facilities.CSA president Chris Nenzani said they aimed to maintain the strength-versus-strength mandate which was at the heart of the restructuring of the domestic game in 2004. At the same time we will maintain the principle of strength versus strength at the highest level of our domestic game " Nenzani said."This has served us well in the past in bringing newcomers through to the various Proteas squads. A key element now is to step up our attempts to make cricket accessible to all and put in place the mechanisms to assist their development."Without making full use of all our human potential both on and off the field we cannot possibly put our best team in the field. - TMG Digital
