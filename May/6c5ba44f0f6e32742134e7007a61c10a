The supercop now trains detectives around the country.Matabane this year received his profession s highest honours - the Minister s Award at the National Excellence Awards - for his work which included securing the conviction of serial killer Thapelo Motseki. He was commander of a task team that stepped in after residents complained about the handling of the investigation. The team of 10 seasoned detectives are part of a Pretoria-based division that deals with community complaints around investigations often assuming the detective duties themselves.It took three-and-a-half years of gruelling detective work to make sure that Motseki did not go unpunished for his crimes. You don t eat you don t sleep because you ve got this information the 54-year-old sleuth said in an interview. In this case we were dealing with a serial killer who murdered kidnapped and raped in the dark corners of the night which means there were no witnesses. We had to rely on circumstantial evidence. We only had DNA said Matabane who has been a detective for 33 years. That case was very much labour intensive. It was very demanding. A sister to one of the victims Cecilia Setuke said the family was still grappling with the pain of Cinthiah s death but had taken heart from Matabane s dedication to ensuring justice. Colonel Matabane did a splendid job. He never got tired nor let any obstacle derail him in doing his job He showed empathy which to any family has a huge impact because it merely means he cared about us and felt our pain. Setuke said Matabane s attitude was a far cry from the bungling that initially followed her sister s murder. The family lodged a complaint with prosecutors over the handling of the case but four years later they are yet to find answers.Matabane has now taken on a new role at the police HQ in Pretoria. I am going to different units giving them guidance and on-the-job training assisting them to solve really complex cases he said.
