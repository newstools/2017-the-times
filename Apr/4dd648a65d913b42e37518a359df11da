Relief was written all over her face as she walked towards a number of stalls lined up around the social grant pay point and pulled out a crisp new R200 note to buy fresh vegetables."After that month-long anxiety I am relieved. I cannot imagine what would have happened if I did not get my pension. Why exactly were we put under so much stress of not knowing whether we would be paid or not? All that worry was for nothing " she said. I m not responsible for Sassa problems Minister Dlamini tells courtThe 75-year-old widow quipped that the government would have to deal with the elderly and the frail who would use their walking sticks and wheelchairs to block the roads in anger if the grants were not paid.The R1 600 is the only lifeline for her and her only daughter and her two grown up grandsons she she shares a cramped home with in Block F."My daughter and her sons are not employed so we survive on this grant.
