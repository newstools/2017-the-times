A statement by Standing Committee on Public Accounts chairman Themba Godi came just hours after the resignation of Dlamini s director-general Zane Dangor who said he had quit due to "a breakdown in the relationship between myself and (Dlamini) on the management of the processes towards ensuring grants are paid".Godi said Dangor was one of many officials in the department and the South African Social Security Agency who have been frustrated by (Dlamini s) heavy-handed interference in Sassa s administrative matters . Dlamini had been summoned to explain herself to Scopa on Tuesday he said.Dangor s departure just four months since his appointment is a blow to hopes that social grants relied upon by 17 million people will continue being paid after Sassa s contract with Cash Paymaster Services ends on March 31.Godi said in Scopa s interactions with Dangor he had proven himself to be an honest and hardworking civil servant .He added: Clearly the CPS contract negotiations have been handled to the disadvantage of the state and grant recipients especially around the issue of deductions which have been a major thorn for recipients. The minister must now take full responsibility for this. The department is clearly falling apart. As Scopa we are looking forward to meeting with the minister on Tuesday so that all these matters can be fully ventilated. It is now becoming very difficult to explain the capability of the minister to effectively run the department and the discharge of her responsibilities. Scopa cannot be quiet or indifferent to these levels of mismanagement which create unease and anxiety in the nation and comes at a huge financial cost to the state."TMG Digital/TimesLIVE
