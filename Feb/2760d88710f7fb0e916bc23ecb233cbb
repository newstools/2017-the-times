Bucs were impressive in patches in Jonevret s first game as coach in the 1-1 draw against Polokwane City at Orlando Stadium on Saturday.A soaked pitch made for tough conditions.Generally though Pirates showed signs of a better structure in defence and direction going forward.An Mpho Makola error giving the ball away in his own half led to Rodney Ramagalela s opener for City in the 54th minute.Bucs profited when Thapelo Tshilo missed a regulation header in Polokwane s area to gift Dove Wome a 58th-minute equaliser.Riyaad Norodien hit the upright in the dying seconds denying Jonevret a win in his first game.Overall having had half-a-week to train the team Joneveret could not have asked for too much more even if he was not satisfied with a draw . Most times when we have a draw I'm not satisfied the 54-year-old Swede said. It could be sometimes."For example when the team scored in the 93rd minute in Cape Town [against Cape Town City last week] then it could be a little OK. But today I was hoping for a victory."So we could get rid of that talk that we have not won for a long time."But at the same time there was a lot of things that we saw today and there were some big players. Of course this was the first time I saw the players from the sideline in a game."And of course there were a few I was really impressed by and a few I d have to talk a bit to and expect a bit more next time. It s not going to be immediate."This is going to take a bit more time. But of course now we can start working on a bit of a higher level next week than we did this week because we have learned a bit more about each other. So hopefully we are going to get better and better."But I m not satisfied. I want to win. - TMG Digital
