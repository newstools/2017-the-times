He and Buthelezi later secretly married.Ramogibe was shot dead on February 17 1999 in the company of police as he went with them to point out the scene of where he had been shot several weeks earlier as he was walking in Vosloorus.Police claimed that they had been ambushed at the scene and Ramogibe was shot dead.An inquest cleared Mdluli of any involvement in the murder of the taxi driver.Buthelezi died of an illness in 2003.Mdluli testified that he held no resentment against the couple.Both men have pleaded not guilty to the charges.Mdluli testified this was all part of a ploy to block his quest to advance to a police commissioner position.The matter was postponed to next Monday. - TMG Digital
