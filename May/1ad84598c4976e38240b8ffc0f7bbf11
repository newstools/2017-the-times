Mahumapelo spoke to mourners at an open field in Scotland informal settlement where Mosweu lived before he died three weeks ago.Two white men Pieter Doorewaard and Phillip Scutte who are in police custody in connection with his murder said he jumped out of a moving bakkie while they were taking him to the police station for stealing the sunflowers.But the state version is that they pushed him out of a moving car.The boy s death sparked riots in the small North West town of Coligny with residents taking to the streets and looting and burning buildings. Mahumapelo said there was no doubt that the teenager died in the hands of "white racists".Mourners agreed with his sentiments at the emotionally charged funeral service. I am not a racist but I have a problem with white people who continue to be racists and practise white superiority and who think that a life of a black person is nothing he said.Mahumapelo questioned a petition signed by over 100 white people in Coligny who were pleading with the court to grant bail to the two accused. Why were they signing a petition that was only signed by white people? Why do they think only white people must come to the rescue of other white people who are alleged to have killed Matlhomola? he asked. Sadtu provincial chairman Mxolisi Mbomvana said while it was correct that not all not all white people were racists their actions spoke louder than words. We want to see the same white people marching with us to court fighting racism if they are saying they are not racists " he added.The bail hearing of the two men is expected to continue on Monday at the Coligny Magistrate s Court.South African Civic Organisation (Sanco) provincial secretary Packet Seaketso said they would be marching to the court to oppose bail.Matlhomola was laid to rest at the Tlhabologang cemetery.- TMG Digital/SowetanLIVE
