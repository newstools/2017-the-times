If you live in Seapoint‚ Illovo or Parkhurst‚ you're staying in three of the new elite suburbs in South Africa. Property in the country's fastest-growing elite suburbs cost between R8‚000 and R30‚000 per square metre‚ almost three times lower than that in the country's most exclusive neighbourhoods.
