Q. I am a 40-year-old male and I would like to know if it is possible for a man to have his penis enlarged? A. Much of the worry, sometimes bordering on obsession, about penis size is fuelled by measuring a flaccid or non-erect penis and then comparing it to data used to measure an erect penis. The length of a non-erect penis cannot be used to predict length when the penis is erect. If your penis is about 13cm or longer when erect, it's of average size. A penis is considered abnormally small only if it measures less than 7.5cm when erect. If a penis enlargement or enhancement procedure is desired, prior counselling is recommended. Some issues to consider are: • A generous waistline can make your penis appear small by comparison. Losing excess girth around the belly can help; • If you have general self-esteem or body-image concerns, penile enlargement by itself may not help emotional wellbeing; • Procedures differ in success from surgeon to surgeon, not many are permanent, and usually several are required; • Creams and lotions do not offer lasting results beyond temporarily enlarging blood vessels responsible for erections; • Vacuum pumps are popular with men who have spinal injuries, but overuse of these can damage elastic tissue in the penis, leading to less firm erections; and • A weighted device can stretch the penis, but more research is needed to establish the safety and effectiveness of this method. Popular enhancement procedures include the use of tissue grafts and injectable gel. It is of utmost importance to seek help from a specialist urologist and sometimes a plastic surgeon. • Dr Tlaleng Mofokeng (MBChB), sexual and reproductive health practice, DISA Clinic, 011-886-2286, visit safersex.co.za.
