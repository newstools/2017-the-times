The SABC released a short statement on Tuesday afternoon confirming that the relaunch of the lifestyle competition will not happen on its platform."The SABC has been in negotiations with the rights holder, production house Rapid Blue, to showcase Come Dine With Me South Africa. However the corporation was informed by the production company that they have subsequently withdrawn their offer for us to produce the show," read the statement.The SABC apologised to viewers and contestants who had already entered the competition."The SABC would like to apologise to all South Africans who adhered to the call to action in anticipation that we would be producing the show."The popular competition to find SA's ultimate dinner party host was set to be relaunced in the country, after it was canned three years ago. The show was previously aired on BBC Lifestyle. We are thrilled to be producing another season of Come Dine With Me, this time on SABC. The series taps into people s fundamental domestic differences, their cooking and their tastes, and what it takes to entertain others in style," said Kee-Leen Irvine, MD of Rapid Blue at the time.There has been no word from Rapid Blue on whether the show will still be aired through another broadcaster.
