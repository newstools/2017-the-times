Khumalo, who has previously spoken out about discovering that she was intersex at 21, told Sowetan that when she first found out she was "shattered.""I just wanted to go home and cry. Sometimes I am okay and then on some days I look at other women who have children and I know I will never have that, but I have learnt to accept that this is the situation and I can't really change that."Sharon does not have ovaries or a uterus and will not be able to have children as a result.Last year she was a top 16 finalist in Miss SA and started a blog to document what she went through.
