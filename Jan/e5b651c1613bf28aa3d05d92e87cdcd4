Jacob Zuma had delivered the address at the party s 105th anniversary celebration on Sunday which had as one of its key themes Unity in Action .Last year more than 100 stalwarts - including Ahmed Kathrada Trevor Manuel Frank Chikane Cheryl Carolus Denis Goldberg Albertina Luthuli Gertrude Shope and Barbara Masekela had signed a document called For the Sake of Our Future in which they lamented the declining state of the country and called for the ANC to hold an early conference to elect new leadership.That led to a meeting with top ANC leaders with a promise to have a follow-up meeting about the stalwarts concerns.The stalwarts in December announced that they would prefer a separate national policy conference from the national consultative conference to hold in-depth discussions about how we correct all the things that contributed to the things that the ANC finds itself in now veteran Wally Serote said.The anti-apartheid struggle veterans had previously argued that the policy conference will not adequately address their key concerns and therefore want a separate national consultative conference to be held in March instead of in June as part of the party s policy conference."We also took a decision that while the national consultative conference will consist of ANC people we also have to consult with other structures [such] as other civil society and other secretarial structures in our country so that there is a comprehensive input into the way forward for the African National Congress " Serote said in December.
