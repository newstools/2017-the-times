Speaking at the opening day of the Cosatu's 6th Central Committee in Irene Pretoria on Monday Cosatu first deputy president James defended the federation's decision to back Ramaphosa."We are making those pronouncements because we want to save the ANC from self-destruction. Cosatu must not be condemned for its choice of who should be the president of the ANC. We want to current deputy president to be the president of the ANC that must be clear " said James to applause.He said that the federation should not be called to order over its Ramaphosa call. It had now become the norm for ANC alliance partners to publicly announce their preferred leadership candidates without disciplinary action being taken.Both the ANC Women's League and the ANC Youth League had earlier this year publicly backed former African Union Chairperson Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma to lead the party.During his opening address Cosatu leader S'dumo Dlamini said it was crucial for Cosatu to continue working with the ANC as it would be nothing without the movement."But the ANC must help us to go through this journey of ensuring that we can build a stronger ANC-led alliance because at the moment it seems decisions can be taken by one partner and they affect all of us and we are not part of those decisions... that must come to an end " Dlamini said.Ramaphosa is expected to deliver a message of support on behalf of the ANC on Tuesday.
