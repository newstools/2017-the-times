That is the impassioned plea by Thoko Mkhwanazi-Xaluva chair of the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of Rights of Cultural Religious and Linguistic Communities (CRL).The deaths of initiates botched circumcisions amputations assaults and dubious traditional practitioners were discussed by the CRL at a hearing on Tuesday in Braamfontein Johannesburg.A woman broke down in tears during the hearings explaining how her nephew was killed at an initiation school because he could not sing.Mkhwanazi-Xaluva said that the death of inmates was often not spoken about in public because it was seen to interfere with cultural integrity."We have kept the secret going and bought in the theory that we should not talk about these issues she said. People are generally scared of approaching issues in the cultural discourse. And that is where the problem begins " she said.TMG Digital reported earlier this year that more than 500 initiates had died in South Africa over the past nine years and the CRL warned that the number will continue to rise if the problem remained unattended.
