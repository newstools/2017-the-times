Celtic, who have three games to go, are now four points above the drop zone but have a tough remaining schedule after now drawing a fourth successive match.Pirates moved one place up to ninth in the Premier Soccer League but were unconvincing as they went through a third game without scoring. I hope this gives us confidence for the last two games and the cup semifinal, said Pirates coach Kjell Jonevret who felt his side should have had a victory based on the number of chances at the Molemela Stadiumn.Two outstanding saves from Patrick Tignyemb denied Dove Wome in the first half as Pirates battled to make their dominance of possession count in front of goal.In the first opportunity in the 16th minute, Wome showed some deft skill in bringing the ball under control and then switching from right to left before thrashing a half volley at goal, only for Tignyemb to be perfectly positioned to make a stop.In the 43rd minute, Wome hit a cracker on the bounce that the flying Tignyemb pushed over the ball with an acrobatic leap.The chances for Pirates came just four minutes after Tendai Ndoro botched a good opportunity following a rare break by Thabo Rakhale on the right.Ndoro, second in the goal scoring charts, looks decidedly short of confidence after netting just a single goal since the turn of the year.He also missed an opportunity with a flick on header from Mpho Makola s cross in the early stages of the second half.Celtic saw Musa Nyatama thunder a shot against the crossbar in the first half but had no other clear cut chances, emphasising why with 15 goals they are the worst scoring side in the Premier Soccer League. - TMG Sport
