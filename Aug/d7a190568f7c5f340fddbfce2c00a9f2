Architect Thomas Heatherwick's transformation of the old grain silos on Cape Town's foreshore into the Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa has brought excitement to the area, which includes a hotel and a shopping precinct. Here are some highlights of this cool new design-and-culture hub: KIRSTEN GOSS Kirsten Goss is known for creating hand-finished jewellery with a distinctive edge. Her Silo space represents a step into couture territory and a reimagining of the South African diamond and gem story. KAT VAN DUINEN Celebs like Solange Knowles and Diane Keaton are fans of this designer's luxe handbags which are made from exotic leathers. GLASSHOUSE REJUVENATION Male grooming experts who have evolved into a unisex salon. Their menu includes eyelash extensions, 6D microblading, hair treatments and pedi-spas. OPUS A botanical flower shop founded by Marissa Pretorius specialising in hanging gardens, flowers and plant-related designs. Known for their signature "potless gardens". SOUTHERN GUILD They've championed high-end design in Africa, propelling South African artist-designers to make challenging and complex work.
