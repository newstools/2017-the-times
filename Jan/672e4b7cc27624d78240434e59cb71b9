The power utility resolved to implement scheduled blackouts to the municipalities all located in the Free State as from Thursday this week.Eskom took this decision on December 22 on the grounds that the municipalities owed it almost R700-million .These local municipalities are Nala Nketoana Dihlabeng Moqhaka Mantsopa Mafube Masilonyana and Tokologo.According to Eskom's plan from Monday to Friday residents would be without electricity between 6am and 8am and again from 5pm to 7.30pm. On weekends power would be cut from 8.30am to 11am and also between 3pm and 5.30pm.But AfriForum the lobby group argues Eskom is wrong to seek to punish residents and local businesses for failures of the municipalities.The group wants the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria to interdict the power utility.Judge Hans Fabricius briefly heard the urgent application on Tuesday. He postponed it to Wednesday to allow himself time to read Eskom's replying affidavit.Eskom only finalised its papers on Monday night while AfriForum brought its application on 29 December.Modise Khoza SC Eskom's lawyer on the matter indicated he will oppose the application on grounds AfriForum has no right to take up the matter.
