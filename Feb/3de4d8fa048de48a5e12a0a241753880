The popular TV and radio personality has faced many trials in her life and revealed, in a candid Instagram Live chat on Tuesday evening, that she chose to not celebrate her birthday for several years after her best friend died on the same day."It was only about three years ago that I could actually face the emotions of the day and choose to accept it as a day of celebration," Lerato said.She said it was just one of several deaths that left her feeling heartbroken."I have overcome so much heartbreak. At times it felt like that pain of losing someone so close to me would never go away. I have been so broken, so now not a lot of things can hurt me."I have lost two best friends. I also lost my other best friend last year, Koyo Bala, and I lost my child the year before," Lerato said, in reference to her miscarriage in 2015.Lerato said that she was sharing her struggles because she wanted others to draw strength from her and see that they too could overcome life's difficulties."I don't want this to be about me. I want you (her fans) to know that no matter what you go through in life, it prepares you for something bigger. It may sound clich but it is true. You are being prepared for something bigger," Lerato said.
