Last year the number of progressed learners registered for matric increased significantly. These pupils did not meet the requirements to be promoted to Grade 12 but were progressed because they had already been held back in the senior education phase once.When Motshekga announced the results she noted that they had been presented in two ways including and excluding progressed pupils. When the number of progressed pupils are included the national pass rate drops from 76.2% to 72.5%.In an executive summary of the results in the department's examination report this is how each province fared when progressed pupils were included:1. Free State 88.2% 2. Western Cape 86% 3. Gauteng 85.1% 4. North West 82.5% 5. Northern Cape 78.7% 6. Mpumalanga 77.1%\ 7. KwaZulu-Natal 66.4% 8. Limpopo 62.5% 9. Eastern Cape 59.3%Motshekga did not announce this provincial breakdown in her speech on Wednesday evening. Instead she reported the provincial results excluding progressed pupils.When progressed pupils are excluded the Free State obtained 93.2% the Western Cape 87.7% Gauteng 87% and North West 86.2%.Though the inclusion of progressed pupils pushed the national pass rate down by almost four percentage points Motshekga said that the policy of progression had borne fruit.Of these progressed pupils 3 335 obtained bachelor passes 12 636 obtained diploma passes and 13 385 obtained higher certificate passes.Progressed pupils also achieved 2 361 distinctions compared to 1 081 in 2015 with some of these attained in accounting mathematics and physical science. The significance of these achievements is that the 29 384 progressed learners who passed the 2016 NSC examinations the would-be high school dropouts if they were not progressed now have the opportunity to either go to university or TVET College said Motshekga. - TMG Digital
