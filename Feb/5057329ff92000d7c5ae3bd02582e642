He will approach the court on an urgent basis as a fight back to the chaotic scenes that unfolded in parliament on Thursday night before Zuma delivered his state of the nation address.An emotional Maimane led his party in a dramatic walkout of parliament saying their safety was in jeopardy after what sounded like a stun grenade was detonated near the chambers. "We decided to leave because they pulled a stun grenade on the top of the gallery. It became unsafe to sit in the chamber. We simply cannot allow it " he said.It later turned out that the 'stun grenade' was in fact canisters of pepper spray.Maimane said the constitution was trampled on to protect one man: Zuma."We refuse to be part of what Jacob Zuma and Baleka Mbete is doing to this house " he said.Maimane said he cannot allow the executive to encroach on the work of parliament."Otherwise tomorrow we must come here armed " he said.Maimane said parliament was allowing the executive to use tear gas stun grenades and the military to shield Zuma who has broken the constitution."The police and the defence cannot come into this precinct. This is the people's parliament " he said.TMG Digital/TimesLIVE
