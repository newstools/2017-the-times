Hunt who has never been afraid to speak his mind has no doubt in his mind that his SuperSport United counterpart Stuart Baxter is headed to the Bafana seat that became vacant after Ephraim Shakes Mashaba s sacking in December last year.The Wits coach said he has never been approached by anyone at Safa House about the Bafana job and he does not expect to receive such a phone call any time soon as the position has already been filled by Baxter. They (Safa) can t call me can they? They ve got Baxter already haven t they? Hunt said in his trademark forthright manner. They have made their decision. They have tried to get three or four coaches and they didn t get them. Safa have struggled to find Mashaba s replacement and there has been an endless parade of coaches linked to the job.Attempts to hire Mozambique-born Carlos Queiroz Frenchman Herv Renard and Belgian Hugo Broos failed but Hunt is certain that Safa finally have their man.United let the cat out of the bag a couple of days ago when announced that they had given Safa permission to engage Baxter. So they (Safa) are taking Stuart and I wish him well and good luck Hunt said Obviously they (Supersport United) have made a comment and they have come out and they have said what they have said. Mashaba was fired for gross misconduct and violation of the Safa communications policy .He still had a year left on his contract which was to run until the end of the 2018 Russia World Cup in July next year and he is challenging his dismissal at the Conciliation Mediation and Arbitration.
