This was the talk on Friday at the Greater KwaDukuza ANC march on the KwaZulu-Natal north coast in defence of President Jacob Zuma. We do not care about the sick rand. It will recover. There s a cure for it. The cure for the rand is the boy from Siqumbe [Malusi Gigaba] said Greater KwaDukuza ANC Youth League chair Mfanafuthi Ngcobo when he addressed about 400 ANC marchers outside the Ballito Junction mall.New Finance Minister Gigaba is from the same region in Siqumbe Mandeni.Regional ANC secretary Thabani Mdlalose called for the en masse bewitching of white people. Let s stop bewitching each other as black people let s start bewitching white people and change things so that more of our people can be employed."Mdlalose said it was unfortunate that the people who are calling for Zuma s head are not the ones that elected him in Mangaung in December 2012.Although the march was relatively peaceful it was the quick thinking of Ilembe cluster commander Major General Mandlenkosi Chirwa who averted a potential confrontational in Ballito between Democratic Alliance and ANC supporters.Chirwa had ensured that the marches do not clash by starting the DA-led march in Ballito at 9am while the ANC was gathering at Shaka s Head 5km away. By the time the ANC arrived in Ballito at 12pm the DA had gone.Chirwa who received the ANC s memorandum of grievances thanked them for their behaviour and conduct. I hope all your issues will be received and answered in line with the constitution of the republic he said amid heckling.Earlier on the crowd had threatened to loot a local KFC outlet prompting police to barricade the area with vehicles.
