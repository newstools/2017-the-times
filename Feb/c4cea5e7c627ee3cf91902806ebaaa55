The labour federation made the call ahead of the anniversary of the disaster, which left three miners trapped underground on February 5 last year.A remembrance ceremony planned for Sunday has been cancelled due to threats by union groups to march on the event.Solomon Nyerenda, Yvonne Mnisi and Pretty Nkambule, were trapped underground when the container they were in fell into a giant sinkhole. Their bodies have still not been retrieved.Shadrack Given Mdluli has still not given up hope that his wife, Yvonne Mnisi's remains will be retrieved from 100m below.Mdluli is upset that there has been no communication from the mine on whether it still intended to try to locate his wife's body."For now we have heard nothing. We have heard that the mine is looking for money to resume its operations, but we have heard nothing," Mdluli said this week while holding a picture of his wife and their young son, Junior, 7.Cosatu also demanded that the mine's management and the Department of Mineral Resources fulfil the many promises that were made to the workers and their families at the time. "Some workers were promised alternative employment and others were promised payments but nothing has happened since those promises were made," Cosatu said.The SA Communist Party said Zwane's "unprocedural, populist promise" had not been honoured."Minister Zwane must either compensate the families out of his own pocket, or profusely apologise to all affected," the SACP said.Christopher Mazibuko, whose wife, Pretty Nkambule, was trapped in the fall as well, said the government should have taken steps to assist in the rescue efforts. Mazibuko's two youngest children live with their maternal grandmother, who stays with the mothers of the two other trapped miners close to Lily Mine.Mazibuko's two older children live with his family in Inkomazi, about 90km away.
