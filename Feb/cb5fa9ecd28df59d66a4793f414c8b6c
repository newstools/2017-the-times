Parliament confirmed on Friday that Molefe had been nominated to "fill a vacancy on the North West list of ANC Members of Parliament which is depleted" a move that has fuelled speculation in some political quarters that he could be about to replace Pravin Gordhan as finance minister.Commenting on the announcement DA chief whip John Steenhuisen said the nomination only confirmed for the umpteenth time that the ANC did not care about fighting corruption. In fact it seems you are more likely to rise in the ANC ranks if you are accused of corruption Steenhuisen asserted. The simple fact is that Molefe is not fit to hold office in Parliament he added.Steenhuisen said the DA had already laid criminal charges against Molefe who was found to be at the centre of State Capture in the Public Protectors "State of Capture" report. The report details the close relationship between Molefe the Guptas and the Zuma family and how they allegedly colluded at the expense of the people of South Africa. This adds credence to the idea that Molefe has his eyes on the finance portfolio and that a Cabinet reshuffle is imminent just days before Pravin Gordhan is due to present the Budget Steenhuisen charged.As an incoming MP Molefe must swear loyalty to the Constitution and commit to put the people of South Africa first not Zuma the Guptas or his own pockets. If Molefe had any inclination to put the people of South Africa above his own self-interest he would have declined Steenhuisen added. If the ANC were serious about fighting corruption they would never have nominated Molefe. But neither Molefe nor the ANC care about serving the people of South Africa. They only care about helping themselves to public money that should be used to create jobs for the 9 million people without work and the lost generation who have given up hope of ever being employed. The fact of the matter is that the ANC will not change they will not stand against corruption as this deployment confirms.
