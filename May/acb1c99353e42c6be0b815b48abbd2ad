Gauteng police spokesperson Mavela Masondo said it was unclear what had sparked the protests. We received a report in the early hours that people have barricaded the Golden Highway in Finetown with stones. When we arrived on the scene we found that the road was blocked and began to remove the stones while ensuring that the violence is curbed he said. No injuries have been incurred [nor have there been] arrests at this point. When it began there were about a 100 to 120 people on the scene but at this point there are about 30 as the police managed to calm the situation and disperse the crowd. Residents blocked the roads and threw rocks at passing motorists Faizel Patel tweeted around 6.30 am on Friday morning.
