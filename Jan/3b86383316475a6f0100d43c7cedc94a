The animals were set free on Tuesday night by sanctuary owner Pat O'Neill 91 who said she made the decision because it was impossible for her to evacuate them. I didn't want all of them to get killed in the fire. It would have been too difficult to take them in my car she said. O Neill s pet chimpanzee Kalu which has lived with her for more than 40 years was at her home in Somerset West. All the animals made their way back to the sanctuary yesterday some through the help of good Samaritans in the area. The baboons actually stayed on the roof of the house and the vervets went off and they came back again. The dogs were all rescued by someone who stays here said O Neill. She had been overwhelmed by the public support but was worried about fire damage at her sanctuary. It's not looking too good at the moment but touch wood the animals are all back and happy again she said.- TMG Digital/The Times
