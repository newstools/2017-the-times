Jali made just a single appearance for the side in the first half of the season having made clear his desire to leave in the last transfer window.He was also hampered by injuries but now having regained full fitness Vanderhaeghe says it is like having a new signing for the team.And with club skipper S bastien Siani at the African Nations Cup finals in Gabon with Cameroon the coach says it has opened the door for Jali to make an immediate impact. The past six months were not enjoyable for him but the stage is now set for a new start for Jali Vanderhaeghe said. He has shown what he has up his sleeve and is again available for selection. He's a bit like a new signing for us and because we are missing Siani in his position we might use Jali quite quickly."That could be as soon as Tuesday night with Oostende to take on Genk in the semifinals of the Belgian Cup the club s first game of 2017.Oostende are at home in the first leg with the return to be played on January 31.Zulte-Waregem and Eupen who have the South African pair of Ntuthuko Radebe and Phakamani Mngadi on their books contest the other semifinal.KO Oostende have not won a major trophy in their 113-year history and so Jali has the chance to be part of history. His possible return to action will be good news for the incoming Bafana Bafana coach.He played for the national side in their 2-1 world Cup qualifier victory over Senegal in November but looked woefully out of touch.It was not surprising given that it was only his second competitive outing in two months. - TMG Digital
