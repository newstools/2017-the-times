Elgar who scored 140 in the first innings made 89 in the second dig to help South Africa reach 224/6 when bad light ended play a lead of 191.The home side will fancy their chances but with rain forecast from Saturday night until Sunday evening a draw seems likely.South Africa resumed on 38/1 and lost Hashim Amla to the 13th ball of the day when Neil Wagner induced a looping catch to midwicket.Wagner struck again to trap JP Duminy in front for 39 and end a partnership of 74.That brought Faf du Plessis to the crease and with him 80 runs for the fourth wicket.The stand ended when Elgar heaved off-spinner Jeetan Patel into Kane Williamson s hands at long-off.He batted for more than six hours faced 249 balls and hit nine fours.That was the start of a slide of three wickets for 25 runs in 10 overs.Notably Quinton de Kock was clean bowled by a turning delivery from Patel the fourth time in as many innings two of them in the one-day series that he has been dismissed by the off-spinner.The size of South Africa s eventual lead would seem to be in the hands of Du Plessis who was 56 not out at stumps.With him was the competent Vernon Philander on one and with Keshav Maharaj s decent batting ability in reserve the visitors can expect to build their lead significantly weather permitting.But the New Zealanders will be kicking themselves.They dropped Duminy once and did not call for a review that would have ended his innings while Elgar survived three chances and was reprieved by a review.Worse fast bowler Trent Boult left the field with an upper leg injury that precluded him from taking the second new ball.The extent of Boult s injury is not known but the home side could be depleted in the batting department by the torn calf that saw stalwart Ross Taylor retire hurt in the first innings.- TMG Digital/TMG Sport
