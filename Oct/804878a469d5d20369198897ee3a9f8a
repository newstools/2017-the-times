Wednesday morning was full of woe for motorists and commuters in the southern suburbs of Cape Town. Main Road through Wynberg was closed after a car and a minibus taxi were involved in a collision. The VW Polo then demolished four pillars holding up the canopy in front of a shop between Rockley and Langley roads. City of Cape Town spokesman Maxine Bezuidenhout said two women in the shop were slightly injured. In another incident‚ a car and a train collided at a level crossing next to False Bay station. No one was hurt. The level crossing‚ in Albertyn Road‚ Muizenberg‚ has been manually controlled since January‚ when a truck crashed into the crossing’s boom gate and brought down overhead wires‚ damaging the signalling system between False Bay and Kalk Bay.
