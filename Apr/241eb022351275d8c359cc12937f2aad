This follows a raid on his house last week where an unknown gas was allegedly released before Hichilema was arrested by Zambian police it said. The DA calls on the Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Ms Maite Nkoana-Mashabane to engage with the Zambian government over this very concerning situation. Importantly the Minister should urge that Zambian government to give access to independent medical personnel to assess Hichilema s health and to ensure that his human rights are being upheld said DA spokesman on international relations and cooperation Stevens Mokgalapa. .He said the DA condemned all actions which would seek to disrespect due process and the rule of law. The arbitrary arrest of political opponents in Zambia is deeply concerning in a constitutional democracy such as Zambia. Moreover the grave human rights concerns that are associated with this arrest are condemnable. If the ANC-led government is still committed to a human rights based foreign policy which they should be then the Minister needs to make a statement against these actions and needs to put pressure on her Zambian counterparts to release Mr Hichilema.
