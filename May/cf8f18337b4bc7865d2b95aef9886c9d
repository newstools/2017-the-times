Alan Winde will lead the inaugural 742km Cross Cape cycling route which starts on May 11 in Plettenberg Bay.The route is an initiative of Project Khulisa a growth strategy implemented by Winde in order to develop tourism. As a region cycling is already in our economy. From an event point of view it adds R1.5 billion and R1 billion in cycle sales. So you can see there is a substantial business. One of the areas we lack in however is the continual advancement and creation of new cycling routes. The Cross Cape is one we will begin to market and learn from Winde said.Khulisa has already created 50 000 of an expected 100 000 jobs according to the ministry. Those new jobs will mostly be created outside of our attractions. This is one of those projects where we can take people out of the main tourist hubs and get them into areas that have room for growth Winde said.The ride will cover around 80 kilometres per day and it will end in Stellenbosch. This new route opens up new job opportunities across various sectors for our residents and visitors will have the opportunity to discover and explore the many hidden gems tucked away in our valley said Stellenbosch executive mayor Gesie van Deventer.Following the conclusion of Winde s ride Cross Cape will remain open at no cost to the public.Winde said he hoped the trail would foster lasting growth for these communities. When we started this project we looked at what the job creating engines of our economy were and tried to find the most inclusive sectors of growth. We then chose tourism because it fosters that inclusive growth across the board Winde said.His department has extended an invitation to the public to take part in the inaugural ride. Interested riders can book accommodation through local entrepreneurs or ride unsupported along with Winde.
