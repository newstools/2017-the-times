Carla Britz-Borges took responsibility for ensuring that her friend who she would prefer not to name got a dignified send-off. "I tried to trace her parents and eventually I got hold of a half brother and a half sister who donated some money towards the cremation. The rest I borrowed from my father because I am unemployed " she said. She asked Tony Naidoo at the Phoenix Funeral Service to give her the ashes in a baggie wrapped in cloth and says he agreed to do this. She has planned to scatter the ashes on the South Coast. On Tuesday morning a driver from the funeral home dropped off the ashes in a Shoprite bag with a hole in it. "The ashes were spilling from the plastic packet as I carried it in. I was flabbergasted. I ve had dogs that were given a better send off. I had to deal with the entire process since her death and to get her back in a Shoprite bag was heartbreaking " she said. Britz-Borges immediately posted a picture of the bag on Facebook. She paid the funeral home R5,200 for their services. Naidoo said Britz-Borges and her family "wanted the ashes how they wanted" them because they had said they planned to dispose of them in the sea. "So I sent it to them. We put it in a plastic [bag] because they were disposing [them] " he said. He denied that he was asked to wrap the ashes in a cloth. "No she never asked me that. Because they were going to dispose of it we put it into a packet. I did apologise to the woman about two hours ago " said Naidoo. - TMG Digital/The Times
