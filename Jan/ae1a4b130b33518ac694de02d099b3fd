Describing yesterday's official release of the results by Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga as an "annual shindig", the body said the pass rate was a "superficial and misleading indicator of public education quality".Instead, the focus should be on Grade R to Grade 3 learners rather than trying to fix results when pupils are in matric, the NGO said. "Early learning is currently crippled by difficulties, including overcrowded classrooms and the lack of support for early childhood development and foundation phase [Grades R to 3] teachers."Shockingly, there is persistent over-investment in Grade 12, when the largest investment is needed in the early school stages."Equal Education has repeatedly cautioned against the national preoccupation with the matric pass rate."For one, the pass rate reflects only the performance of those learners who managed to stay in school for 12 years, and obscures how many dropped out along the way," general secretary Tshepo Motsepe said.The matric pass rate for the class of 2016 increased by about two percentage points, from just over 70% the year before.Motsepe said the emphasis on Grade 12 performance was detrimental. He said teachers performed what was known as "teaching the test", a process in which pupils are trained to answer specific test questions and not taught broader context and skills. Teachers also did so-called "gaming", "culling" or "gatekeeping", which is when schools hold back learners or encourage them to take different subjects to improve the ' pass rates."In South Africa the enormous emphasis on a school's matric pass rate means schools employ these destructive tactics to boost results and avoid being classified as an underperforming school," he said.The real reason for matric underperformance in recent years, the lobby group said, was because of a lack of investment at the foundation phase level. "To fix what is wrong in matric, start at the very beginning: early childhood development," said Motsepe.Under-resourced rural provinces, particularly the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and Limpopo, continue to bear the brunt of poor matric results."In rural provinces, schools have fewer teachers per learner and learners often have to walk cruel distances to get to school. All of these factors impact on teaching and learning," he said.
