SuperSport United’s ace Kiwi striker Jeremy Brockie has a new pair of boots he is set to unleash on Orlando Pirates in the Nedbank Cup final‚ and he hopes they are scoring ones. Brockie scored SuperSport’s opening goal of their 3-2 win against Pirates in last year’s Nedbank final in Polokwane. He will be the danger man for SuperSport again in Saturday night’s rematch at Moses Mabhida Stadium (kickoff: 8pm)‚ as Matsatsantsa aim to become the first team to defend the trophy in the competition’s incarnation as the Nedbank Cup. “I’ve got the new pair of boots sitting in the cabinet waiting to be released for Saturday‚ and hopefully there’s goals in them‚” Brokcie said this week. “It would be nice to contribute that way‚ but the most important thing is the team lifting the trophy.” Brockie‚ scorer of 17 goals in all competitions so far this season‚ and 18 in 2015-16‚ is reportedly a target of Mamelodi Sundowns and Pirates. The New Zealander may be playing his last match for SuperSport‚ at the same time that his national team have been doing duty at the Fifa Confederations Cup in Russia. Brockie (29) was not selected by All Whites coach Anthony Hudson. It will certainly be the last game at SuperSport for coach Stuart Baxter‚ who becomes Bafana Bafana coach full-time after the final. “It will definitely be nice to send him off with a trophy. He’s done wonders for the club since he’s taken over and in the short amount of time that he’s been here‚” Brockie said. “But he he’s made it clear that he wants us to go and win the trophy for ourselves‚ for the change room‚ for the club. Not to give him some sort of happy ending. “So‚ ideally‚ from a personal point of view he’s been magnificent and I’ve really enjoyed working under him‚ so it would be nice to send him off with some fond memories.” - TimesLIVE
