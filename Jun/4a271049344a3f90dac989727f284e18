SuperSport United once again humiliated Orlando Pirates to retain the Nedbank Cup and give coach Stuart Baxter a good send-off. Baxter’s and SuperSport’s party was dampened by acts of hooliganism from the Ghost who invaded the pitch in frustration as their club was thumped 4-1. One of the fans who invaded the pitch went to the bench to ask them what’s happening while another, brandishing a vuvuzela, went straight to goalkeeper Siyabonga Mpontshane to have a stern word with him. Unlike when the Ghost ran amok at Loftus Versfeld, where Mamelodi Sundowns gave them a 6-0 drubbing, security was quick to act to avoid a bloodbath. But it was still ugly. Matsatsantsa a Pitori toyed with the Buccaneers. The Tshwane side could have done more than Bradley Grobler’s brace which was complimented by goals from Jeremy Brockie and Kingston Nkhatha. Oupa Manyisa’s late goal didn’t even console the Buccaneers such is the extent of the damage that SuperSport did on the Seas Robbers. SuperSport were sharper than Pirates who have been inactive for almost a month after their last league game at this venue against Golden Arrows on May 27. While the Buccaneers only had training sessions and practise matches to keep busy, SuperSport faced five-time African champions TP Mazembe twice. Matsatsantsa a Pitori drew with Mazembe in Lubumbashi and should have beaten them in Atteridgeville on Tuesday instead of playing to another draw. Those results gave the Tshwane side confidence coming into this match and it showed in how they controlled proceedings. This loss further compounded the Buccaneers’ woes, turning their 80th anniversary into something they would like to quickly forget. - TimesLIVE
