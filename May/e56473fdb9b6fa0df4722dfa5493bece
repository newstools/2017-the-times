Novella was visibly upset after a lunch adjournment in which he and his lawyer William Booth reviewed the images of Gabriela Alban. Her body was found at the Camps Bay Retreat Boutique Hotel in July 2015.The Guatemalan has shown little emotion at his various court appearances but he wore a pained expression on Tuesday as Judge Vincent Saldhana read aloud the detailed description of injuries sustained by Alban.Multiple haemorrhages a fractured hand and a severe groin injury sustained during sexual penetration led a long list.Alban s father Howdy Kabrins from California in the US said it was time after months of no emotion to see Novella s macho man act break. Kabrins testimony was delayed when Saldhana agreed to adjourn the case until Wednesday.Saldhana warned Booth that if he chose to proceed with a diminished capacity defence his client would still be criminally liable and would face a competent verdict.This defence was based on initial reports by a panel of physicians at Valkenberg psychiatric hospital who found that at the time of the murder he did indeed suffer from diminished responsibility due to drug ingestion.Saldhana refused to accept this decision as a reasonable defence because of the same panel s determination that Novella was competent to stand trial.Further conflict came at the end of the morning s proceedings when Novella became visibly upset as Saldhana announced that crime scene photos would become public.Novella repeatedly asked what the benefit of publishing these photos would be to which Saldhana only replied he could not speak on behalf of the media or public.Saldhana cautioned reporters in the gallery to proceed with extreme caution when handling crime scene photographs. These images are explicit and may upset the people that see them. They must be handled with care and with absolute respect for the dignity of the deceased Saldhana said.-TMG Digital/TimesLIVE
