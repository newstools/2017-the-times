Cope s Dennis Bloem noted that it was during his term as ANC president that the party had two breakaways his party and the Economic Freedom Fighters and said there is the possibility of the party having a third breakaway party lurking in the horizon . Its alliance partner Cosatu also split in the middle under Zuma he said of the trade union federation.Bloem also took aim at Zuma s invoking of late ANC president OR Tambo at the Orlando Stadium celebrations on Sunday saying: The old man must be turning in his grave as he is grossly misrepresented. Zuma s actions are a far cry from those of Mr Oliver Tambo. The majority of the country knows that he Zuma does not have the moral authority to talk about Tambo. He said Zuma s statement was empty with rehashed content and was full of the old rhetoric about the history of the ANC . As a governing party it gave no direction for the future of this country - this clearly exposing the ANC as a party which lost its direction. Instead the speech was dominated by calls for unity in the ranks of the ANC and the alliance - this as a sign that there are big divisions within the ANC and with its alliance.
