Thulani Hlophe immediately pulled over to the side of the road and ran from the vehicle. When he spoke to TimesLIVE from the scene he said smoke had emerged from under the bonnet spurring him to call the fire department but both Hlophe and Ford South Africa have since said it was steam as a result of water escaping from the vehicle s coolant bottle. We can confirm that Mr Hlophe s 1.6 Kuga had the safety recall repair action completed at the end of January with the vehicle s cooling system thoroughly tested before leaving the dealership a Ford spokesman said."Mr Hlope has confirmed that on the morning of the incident he checked the coolant level and gave it a top-up. Hlophe told TimesLive the Ford dealership in Mbombela said his vehicle s coolant bottle needed to be replaced but as they didn t have a replacement in stock he should return next week.The vehicle was towed to the dealership Numbi Ford and Hlope has the use of a courtesy car while his Kuga is being repaired.Fifty-two 1.6l Kugas manufactured between 2012 and 2014 in Valentia Spain and which were sold in South Africa have caught alight since December 2015 when Reshall Jimmy burnt to death in his vehicle.In mid-January Ford announced a safety recall of 4556 1.6 Kugas due to them being potentially susceptible to overheating due to a lack of coolant circulation which in some cases could cause an engine overheat with a resulting crack in the cylinder head .The company is still busy with Stage 1 of the recall - replacing affected components on the cooling system verifying and updating the software and conducting an oil leak check on the cylinder head."We can confirm that there have been no incidents reported since the launch of the safety recall on 16 January 2017 and wish to remind 1.6 Kuga customers with concerns to contact Ford Customer Service directly at 0860 011 022 or email CRC3@ford.com the spokesman said. - TMG Digital/The Times
