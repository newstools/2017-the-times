While he has picked a very strong match-day 23 squad with eight Springboks for the opening round clash with the Cheetahs in Bloemfontein tomorrow, Ackermann insisted it was all about what they needed to do this year.Lionel Mapoe has been shifted to right wing, while Ruan Combrinck recovers from a shoulder injury.Howard Mnisi will fill in for Mapoe at outside centre, whereas Ruan Dreyer will deputise for the incapacitated Julian Redelinghuys."You have to stay in the moment and not many teams are able to go right through Super rugby winning, especially with this format."There have been examples of teams that started badly yet went on to win the tournament."The Hurricanes set the example last year. That shows you can turn it around if you win plenty of matches on the trot. Some teams know how to get momentum and keep it," Ackermann said.The last time the South African rugby cat fight took place in Bloemfontein, Ackermann's side was on the receiving end of a 55-17 shellacking in the Currie Cup semi-final. Franco Smith has 16 survivors from that game and the team will be captained by hooker Torsten van Jaarsveld. The noticeable absentee is the injured captain Francois Venter.Ackermann was not quite accurate when he said there were not any players from last year's thrashing. There are 13 players in the Lions' match-day 23 who were frazzled in Bloemfontein.But Ackermann said that result will count for nothing."We've changed some stuff, looked at our game and at ways in which we can improve our game. They probably also have some different ideas and tactics," Ackermann said.
