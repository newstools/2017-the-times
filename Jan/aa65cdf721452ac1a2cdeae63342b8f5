While working in the Cape Floristic Region researchers from Stellenbosch University identified a positive correlation between insect and plant richness.The researchers also suggest that insect diversity is higher in the Cape than in other areas of the globe with similar conditions due to the vast diversity of plant species. We assessed this relationship by looking at Restionaceae one of the dominant plant families in the region and [found that] plant species richness was a persistent significant predictor of insect richness said Jurene Kemp and Allan Ellis writing in the journal PLOS ONEKnown as South Africa s most important biodiversity hotspot the Cape Floristic Region is home to more than 9 000 plant species.Kevin Balkwill president of the South African Association of Botanists said knowing how biodiversity was dispersed around the planet enabled scientists to prioritise areas for conservation. It helps us understand what factors contribute to a rich or poor number of species which allows us to manage conservation more effectively. - TMG Digital/The Times
