Tucked away, wrapped in his yellow blanket, listening to his little radio, his is the world of the anonymous and the forgotten.Yet he is like the rest of us. He is a 45-year-old man with a history and a family and ambitions and dreams.He left his family in King William's Town two months ago, looking to fulfil his life in Johannesburg like generations of others have done before him.But those dreams remain a dream too far; his world instead has shrunk to a body-length space in a city wall from where he emerges once a day to wash and buy food.What he misses most is that ordinary ritual so familiar to all of us. He longs for Jungle Oats at breakfast with his mother and two sisters back at home.Yet here he is, in the City of Gold, just another brick in the wall.As Shiyani lies there in his yellow blanket, with passing strangers averting their eyes, in Cape Town our leaders will this week debate the State of the Nation speech which was delivered amid an outrage of violence, screams and insults last Thursday night.The script for the next couple of days is so predictable it is now a cliche.The ruling party will defend President Jacob Zuma and will attest to the triumphs of the ANC's administration. Opposition parties, or at least those who deign to attend, will denounce them all.It's hard not to wonder if this is not the true state of our nation: selfish elites obsessed with the next manoeuvre and point to be scored perched at the top, and the rest of us, South Africans like Shiyani, shoved into the cracks in the wall, waiting and hoping that someone will listen.
