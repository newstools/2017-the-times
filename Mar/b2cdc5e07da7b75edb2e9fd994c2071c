Mroza sings maskandi so he can't be there. Our gospel artists such as Thokozile Langa is not there. Not everyone is there. There are people who won the Metros and those that did not.

The rapper caused a storm after he blasted the entire music and radio industry during his acceptance speech.Mabala Noise was also accused of "buying awards," a claim that the label has also rubbished.
