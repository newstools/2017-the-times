He retired from active politics in 2006 the SACP said.The party called on African leaders to deepen the struggle to advance the African revolution in honour of liberation heroes such as Ya Toivo. Africa is not independent yet because of persisting imperialist domination and capitalist exploitation of its resources and people. The masses of our people remain impoverished across the board while a few both national and foreign exploiters are becoming rich and richer out of the exploitation. The SACP is reiterating its call for African continental unity to continue and deepen the struggle to advance the African revolution in honour of the exceptional founders and leaders of our national liberation movements of who Cde Toivo was one.
