"I was late for my appointment at the dentist. I was about to go in when it happened. In my mind, I didn't think the roof would fall. I'm lost for words," she said."All I saw was the roof collapse, and then there was a lot of dust. I could just hear people scream and then we came outside," she said. "I'm glad I wasn't trapped inside, but I still feel really bad for the people trapped inside."
