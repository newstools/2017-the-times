 Our intention is to put the compliant proposals on display for public viewing and comment from March 6 said Brett Herron the City of Cape Town mayoral committee member for transport and urban development. Mayor Patricia de Lille said last year that she wanted something done about the city s unfinished foreshore freeways which had no purpose other than occasionally being used for video and movie shoots. The council requested plans from developer consortiums and De Lille said the city was offering the winning bidder six hectares on the Foreshore in return for a plan to alleviate traffic congestion and provide affordable housing. Not only are [the unfinished freeways] useless they are preventing the development of prime city-owned land " she said at the time. - TMG Digital/The Times
