But the 28-year-old Belgian has just spent 90 days at much closer quarters with the ocean alone in a 6.5-metre yacht on a voyage from Belgium to Cape Town the city where he lived as a child and learned to sail.In the process he raised R710 000 for charities working to combat multiple sclerosis the disease his father has battled for 10 years.Donn journeyed from Belgium through the English Channel along the coast of north-western Africa across the Atlantic to Brazil and finally Cape Town.He faced a number of challenges and close calls and at one point could only sleep in 20 minute intervals having to constantly be aware of his dangerous surroundings. He was also forced to stop at the Spanish Canary islands after a storm damaged his solar panel wiring which meant no electrical power for his boat.But Donn said one of the most challenging legs of the trip was from Salvador to Cape Town with no possible pit stops along the way and regular storms.The voyage proved tough not only physically but mentally. Of course there were times that you think 'what am I doing?' being thousands of kilometres away from the nearest support being all alone in the middle of the Atlantic during Christmas he said. But then I thought of the thousands of people following and supporting the project. And most of all about what people with MS to go through day by day. Although he is thrilled to be back on land and with his family who flew out from Belgium to greet him on Tuesday he is not ruling out a similar trip in the future. Managing and undertaking the [project] really got the entrepreneur out of me and I know sitting still is not really my thing. So although I do not know what yet this most probably is not the end. - TMG Digital/The Times
