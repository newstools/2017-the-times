The Democratic Alliance said Dhlomo had to assist at the Pinetown mortuary on Friday which is plagued by a shortage of staff . According to sources the mortuary currently does not have a forensic pathologist which has led to the pile-up of bodies said Imran Keeka DA spokesman on health in KwaZulu-Natal.Dhlomo had to clear his schedule on Tuesday to assist with post-mortems at Park Rynie. Bodies were also transferred from Park Rynie to Port Shepstone.The department said earlier this week that Dhlomo s assistance would ensure that all bodies that required burial would be examined by the weekend.Keeka said the situation could have been averted had the MEC and his officials listened to staff grievances at mortuaries and ensured fair labour practice .
