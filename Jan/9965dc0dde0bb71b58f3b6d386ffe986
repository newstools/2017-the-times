The decision which follows the retesting of hundreds of samples from the Beijing event, means teammate Usain Bolt loses one of the three gold medals he won at that Olympics. Carter was found to have tested positive for banned substance Methylhexanamine."Nesta CARTER, 31, of Jamaica, competing in the men s 4x100m relay event (round 1 and final) in which he and his teammates ranked 1st and for which they were awarded the gold medal, has been disqualified from the Olympic Games Beijing 2008. "Re-analysis of Carter s samples from Beijing 2008 resulted in a positive test for the prohibited substance methylhexaneamine," the IOC said in a statement on Wednesday.The loss of the relay gold deprives Bolt of one of his 'triple triples' -- he won gold in the 100m, 200 and the 4x100m at Beijing and then went on to repeat the feat in London in 2012 and again in Rio last year.
