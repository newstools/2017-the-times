"The news precipitated material moves in the value of numerous listed securities, including currency futures. The JSE will forward its findings to the Financial Services Board," said JSE director of market regulation Shaun Davies.On March 27 President Jacob Zuma abruptly recalled Gordhan from meetings with investors and ratings agencies in London, sending banks, government bonds and the rand weaker.The JSE reviews trading in listed securities ahead of any market-moving event to identify activity that might warrant investigation by the Financial Services Board's market abuse department.Davies would not be drawn on which securities were being investigated but it is likely that banking stocks will be among them.Banks were hit hard by news of the recall, which culminated in Gordhan's firing, sending bank shares even lower.Traders can profit from declines in share prices by "shorting" stocks, which entails borrowing shares from brokers, selling them and buying them back later at a lower price, profiting on the difference.Having hit an 18-month high earlier in the day, the rand reacted strongly to the news of Gordhan's recall, closing 1.7% weaker. It was 8% off its high by March 31, further weakened by Zuma's cabinet reshuffle.Mohamed Sola, a trader, said there was increased trading of dollar-rand currency futures around the time the news of the recall broke.Currency futures are contracts for the exchange of one currency for another on a specified future date."The timing of this trade might have been suspiciously accurate," particularly given the strength of the rand shortly before trading was executed and the news broke, Sola said. - BDLive
