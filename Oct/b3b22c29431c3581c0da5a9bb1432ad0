An old favourite conveniently pre-prepared. We loved the soft maize balls in a rich tomato sauce flavoured with bacon and topped with cheese which melts decadently over everything. Price: R59.99 for 750g A novel idea - individual puff-pastry pies with a filling of stewed apple. They don't look that appealing but once cooked over the coals and served with a dollop of cream, custard or ice cream, they are delicious. Good value. Price: R39.99 for 4 pies (370g) Lovely bread, crisp on the outside with a soft centre and a generous garlicky filling. Price: R29.99 for 450g The famous Jamie Oliver choc marshmallow pudding idea, made even more delicious with added dark chocolate pieces, lots of mini marshmallows and a drizzle of salted caramel sauce on the top. So yummy. Price: R69.90 for 530g A deliciously clever idea taking a South African favourite, sweetcorn, and putting it into a delicious bake. Very yummy and a great alternative for vegetarians too. Like a softer version of Mexican corn bread. Price: R49.90 for 700g When is a roll not a roll? When it's stuffed with basil pesto and topped with cheese. Very moreish and delicious straight off the coals. Price: R26.90 for 6 rolls (180g) Another local favourite, featuring layers of chocolate crunchies, caramelised condensed milk and caramel mousse, topped with shards of peppermint crisp. Delicious. Price: R69.99 for 480g Looks aren't everything, even when it comes to food. The bread looks so appealing but sadly does not deliver on taste. It's too dry but is improved with a very thick spread of butter. Price: R39.99 Available in two varieties of sweet potato. I particularly liked the orange ones; the potatoes are covered in a buttery sauce and taste way better than they look. Price: R34.99 for 700g A generous layer of cream, almost too generous, covered with a chocolate sauce and lots of flaked almonds. Buried underneath is the tastiest part, a skinny gooey chocolate layer. Price: R59.99 for 450g A standard ciabatta loaf with garlic butter that is sliced too thick, especially if you are on a Banting diet and want to sneak a small piece. A bit on the dry side. Price: R26.99 for 350g Spar have taken all the hassle out of preparing hasselback potatoes and even wrapped each individually in foil. Topped with rosemary we felt they needed way more butter/oil to make them really juicy. Price: R22.99 for 4
