I had just broken up with someone I dated for three years. I didn't think I'd fall in love again, and I told myself I wouldn't allow myself to," she said. Bucie explained that she was disheartened because she dated her ex for so long and he wasn't "the one". However six months after the break-up she met Nhlanhla and the rest as its said is history!
