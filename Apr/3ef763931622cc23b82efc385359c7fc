The provincial wing of the league threatened to "squeeze out" former finance minister Pravin Gordhan following his call for mass mobilisation against the current problems facing the country ."I m unashamedly encouraging mass mobilisation " Gordhan said at the Ahmed Kathrada memorial in Johannesburg on Saturday.;nbstpAddressing the media on Monday morning the league s provincial chair Kwazi Mshengu warned that the organisation would challenge Gordhan on his declaration."Pravin can t mobilise society. Otherwise the ANC would have been dominating in Chatsworth and Phoenix."This is the ANC Youth League we will squeeze out Pravin Gordhan. He has failed to mobilise for the ANC how he will take on such a powerful organisation? Provincial secretary Thanduxolo Sabelo said: "There is a looming political party by Pravin Gordhan. This is how it starts. Remember how COPE started?"Sabelo added that Julius Malema had launched the EFF following his divorce from the ANC.He accused Gordhan of using Kathrada s death to fight his political battles in the ANC."Watch this space... there s a possibly a new party coming. That s why the NEC must reign in Gordhan."The league is planning to bus in thousands of supporters to an Ahmed Kathrada tribute in Durban on Sunday at which Gordhan is scheduled to speak."We will be going there to pay tribute to uncle Kathy.. We loved him. We will be there to defend the ANC and its leadership."Pravin must be ready for us " said Sabelo.The league also lambasted deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe and the party s treasurer general Zweli Mkhize for expressing reservations about the cabinet reshuffle."It is our firm view that the three national officials stooped to their lowest... In the history of the ANC top leaders have always managed and resolved their differences internally."The stance by the three officials have put them firmly on the wrong side of history."Gordhan didn't respond to queries. - TMG Digital/The Times
