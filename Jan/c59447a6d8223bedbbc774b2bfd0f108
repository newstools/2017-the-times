Members and supporters of the ANC attend January 8 statement events to listen to the president of the ANC delivering (the) ANC NEC statement contrary to whatever is suggested by GLB narrative she added. The ANCWL will not allow anyone or any institution to attempt to drag the good name and credibility of the ANC in the mud. The narrative of portraying members and supporters of the ANC coming to January 8 as people who will require extra hours of purchasing liquor is a blatant attempt to insult the principles and values that the ANC stands for. She said the league wants the ANC-led government in Gauteng under Premier David Makhura to condemn this narrative by GLB which tarnishes the good name of our glorious movement .
