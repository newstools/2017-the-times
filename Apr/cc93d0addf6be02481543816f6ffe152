ER24 spokesman Werner Vermaak said it was understood that the six people were all travelling in one vehicle. Two people with fatal injuries were found inside the vehicle and another two with fatal injuries were found several metres away from the vehicle. It is believed they were ejected during the rollover. Two other occupants were found with moderate injuries. They were treated on scene and later transported to a nearby hospital for further care Vermaak said.
