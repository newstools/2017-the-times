Civic activist Yusuf Abramjee told TMG Digital on Tuesday afternoon that he had been in contact with the man s family. All the information we have at this point is that a 22-year-old guy had gone over to Syria with his brother some time ago. They got caught up in the fighting somehow and he was killed. The family will be releasing a statement shortly he added.The dead man's name is being withheld until then. A 22-year-old Durban man has been killed in fighting in Syria. He apparently left SA some time ago with his brother. Details sketchy. #Syria Yusuf Abramjee (@Abramjee) February 14, 2017A 22-year-old Durban man has been killed in fighting in Syria.
