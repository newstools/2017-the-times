Again next week She later took to Instagram to explain that she had told her family about the idea for The Ranaka's long ago."My father just told me how he remembers how I sold them the concept of Dineos Diary and The Ranakas looong before my 30's, and then he said, 'Dineo, no matter how hard it gets, don't stop. You are a visionary woman and your visions are manifesting,'" she said. Dineo went on to explain that despite the challenging times she felt incredibly blessed. "I am so blessed to live to see the day that God has made - I believe now more than ever that God can indeed do anything for you - He will provide for you," Dineo added.
