The hostel and its security were investigated by then public protector Thuli Madonsela.Community activist Vanessa Burger said the man was shot in the head and killed at an intersection close to the hostel. She said he was a key witness in a murder case."[He was the] boyfriend of, and witness to the murder of, the young Glebelands woman allegedly killed by her former lover exactly a week ago," she said.Burger said the man killed had fled his room at the hostel after his partner was murdered."Since fleeing immediately after his partner's murder a week ago, the former block 57 resident was seen returning with his belongings to Glebelands on Friday."Although the man was rumoured to have previously enjoyed a cordial relationship with some of the thugs and hitmen at the old blocks, he remained a key witness to a Glebelands murder."Glebelands murder witnesses do not enjoy high life expectancy."It is easy to ensure that there is insufficient evidence in a docket if the key witness is dead, a tactic that also effectively deters others from seeking justice," Burger added.
