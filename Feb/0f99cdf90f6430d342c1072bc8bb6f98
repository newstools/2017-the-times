In a message on Instagram he pointed out that in 2014 immigration regulations stipulated that every company operating in the country applying for work visas must ensure that a minimum of 60% South Africans are employed in that company .Prior to this companies needed only to employ five to six South Africans he said.Gigaba added that he had directed the department s Immigration Services to conduct inspections in many companies to ensure compliance. There are many restaurants hotels guest houses construction mining and other companies that are only employing foreign nationals which undermines our laws and exposes many foreign nationals in our country to risks such as was the case in Durban in May 2015 he said.The Department of Home Affairs was currently drafting a new white paper to address the challenge of economic migrants in South Africa and improve asylum-seeker management. these claims are therefore nonsensical and baseless. Spreading such lies is reckless and must be fought immediately viciously and frontally he added.
