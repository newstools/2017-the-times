Having been failed by the system when he was at the University of Johannesburg under Hugo van As, the significance of Nkosi's position is not lost on him."Black coaches understand where black kids come from. You can't blame white coaches, but ... they often battle to understand where black kids come from."You need black coaches to look after black kids. An example was how the careers of Andile Jho and Jan Serfontein panned out even though they were peers. No one would understand the lack of the important support base that afflicted a player like Andile," he said.While his tenure is three games old, there's no bigger pressure than having to perform at your own Easter festival.KES have to negotiate their way past Wynberg Boys High, Rondebosch and Kingswood College at their festival which starts today.Nkosi may only be 27 but he's been deeply involved with rugby at KES from Grade 8 through to matric when he played alongside Scarra Ntubeni in 2009.He was also part of the coaching staff that guided the Golden Lions Under-18 side to the 2016 Craven Week final at Kearsney College.Nkosi understands the expectations but the backing he has received from the school has put him in a good space."The backing has been massive but it has also been a case of being able to coach but also having to prove yourself. Often as a black coach there's more to the game than just coaching. You have to prove yourself all the time and when you've got backing, the job becomes easier," Nkosi said.
