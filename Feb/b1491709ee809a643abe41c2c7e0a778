South Africa fuelled by AB de Villiers 85 which helped make him the fastest player to score 9000 runs in the format recovered from another middle order slump to total a middling 271/8 after choosing to bat on a pitch that offered movement off the seam.Then they blew the home side away for 112 in 32.2 overs to win by 159 runs and take a 2-1 series lead.Dwaine Pretorius led the way with a career-best haul of 3/5 from 5.2 overs and Kagiso Rabada Wayne Parnell and Andile Phehlukwayo took two wickets each.All of which helped South Africa deliver a starkly improved performance compared their disappointing display in Christchurch on Wednesday when their batsmen frittered away a strong position and New Zealand won by six runs. I put a lot of emphasis on us playing as a team - I didn t feel that in the last game De Villiers said.But the South Africans will still be unhappy with their batting after reaching 114/1 in the 23rd over only to dwindle to 180/6 in the next 16 overs - a slide of 5/66.South Africa s early batting success was thanks to Quinton de Kock s 68 and the stand of 73 he shared with Faf du Plessis for the second wicket.The visitors only other half-century partnership was the 84 that De Villiers and Parnell put on for the seventh wicket.None of those concerns mattered once South Africa s seamers started reeling in Kiwi wickets with apparent ease.The longest a pair of their batsmen stayed at the crease together was the 12 overs that Kane Williamson and Ross Taylor faced in their third-wicket stand of 37.Seven New Zealanders were dismissed in single figures and each of them were outscored by the extras which totalled eight.Colin de Grandhomme s 34 not out was probably all that spared the Kiwis from being dismissed for fewer than 100 runs.Another win for South Africa in Hamilton on Wednesday would clinch the series.- TMG Digital/TMG Sport
