Most consumers rate insurers based on their premiums excesses and the extent of their policies cover but that s only part of the story. Arguably the real measure of an insurer is how it treats its customers in their hour of need - when they have an accident their cars are stolen or hijacked or their homes are burgled - and they make a claim on their policy.For the past five years that information has been laid bare in the Ombudsman for Short-Term Insurance s Annual Report. The so-called overturn rate - the percentage of complaints which the Ombud found against the insurer and in favour of the consumer - is the key figure as it s an indication of the extent to which the insurer was deemed to have been unfair in dealing with a claim.In 2016 the average overturn rate was 27% consistent with previous years - anything above that generally reflects badly on the insurer and a percentage below that especially significantly below makes their marketing departments very excited.Of the 416 complaints OSTI finalised from MiWay clients only 32 7.69% - were overturned in favour of the consumer.And in Outsurance s case 11.63% of its 404 finalised complaints were overturned. Momentum s stats were also very impressive albeit off a much smaller base - of the 70 complaints OSTI finalised it overturned just three - 4.29%.Here s how some other major (in terms of claims numbers) insurers compared: - Absa: 769 complaints 31.47% overturned (above average) - Hollard: 596 complaints 33.89% overturned (above average) - Standard Insurance: 538 complaints 29.55% overturned (above average) - Santam: 553 complaints 26.4% overturned (below average) - Mutual &amp; Federal: 533 complaints 24.95% overturned (below average) - Guardrisk: 442 complaints 48.19% overturned (above average).The number of complaints in itself isn t a measure of a insurer s performance given that it s directly related to the number of claims the company handled that year.The two insurers with the highest overturn rate - discounting those who only had one complaint filed with OSTI - were Vodacom and Shoprite Insurance 61.9% of 36 complaints and 69.23% of 33 complaints respectively.During 2016 OSTI received 14 916 complaints of which 10 175 were registered as formal complaints - 780 more than the previous year.This increase coupled with operational changes and what Ombudman Deanne Wood termed the focus on quality outcomes resulted in 1 313 fewer complaints being closed in 2016.As always motor vehicle insurance claims dominated OSTI s workload comprising 49% of all claims received. It took the office an average of three months to deal with cases from start to finish and in total just short of R100-million was recovered for consumers.To lodge a complaint about your short-term insurer go to www.osti.co.za-TMG Digital/TimesLIVE
