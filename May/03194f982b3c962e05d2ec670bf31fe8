We are against wrong things. Molefe returned to Eskom after a brief stint as a member of parliament where he had allegedly been installed in order to replace Pravin Gordhan as finance minister.But reports have suggested that ANC and SACP leaders rejected President Jacob Zuma s attempt to have Molefe take over from Gordhan in a recent cabinet reshuffle.Molefe had stepped down as Eskom chief executive in November after he was implicated in state capture allegations by former public protector Thuli Madonsela saying that he was leaving in the interests of good corporate governance and to clear his name.Molefe this week resumed his post as Eskom boss after resigning from parliament.The move has been widely criticised including by the ANC.Nzimande said private interests were corrupting and factionalising the ruling party.
