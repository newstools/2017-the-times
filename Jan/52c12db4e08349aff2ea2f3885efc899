The party s information which will be revealed in a press conference follows the launch of an investigation into Phahlane by the Independent Police Investigative Directorate.Last week directorate officers raided Phahlane's luxury Pretoria home in a search of an R80 000 sound system he is alleged to have received in relation to the awarding of a contract to a service provider while he headed the SAPS forensic science laboratory.Phahlane has insisted that he bought the sound system and that there was nothing untoward with the purchase.On Wednesday it emerged that directorate investigators were also looking into Phahlane's acquisition of a fleet of luxury cars over the past two years.The vehicles include a Range Rover Sport Land Rover Discovery a Mercedes Benz E520CDI a VW Polo a Toyota Hliux bakkie which he allegedly received as a gift and a VW Amarok bakkie.A sworn affidavit by a businessman who alleges he bought the Hilux for Phahlane is said to form the basis of the directorate's interest into the commissioner s vehicles.The businessman alleges that he approached Phahlane to be the black economic empowerment partner in his business.DA shadow police minister Zakhele Mbhele will on Thursday morning present alleged evidence which points to apparent corruption by Phahlane.Darren Brookbanks the DA's press officer said Mbhele would provide original documentation in the party's possession which points to the alleged corruption. Our plan is to ensure that this matter receives the urgent attention it deserves. Police leadership must be beyond reproach so that the critical task of fighting crime in our communities becomes our first priority. Phahlane spokesman Brigadier Sally de Beer on Wednesday said all the allegations against the commissioner were false. The allegations were unlawfully leaked to the media and are factually inaccurate. - TMG Digital/TimesLIVE
