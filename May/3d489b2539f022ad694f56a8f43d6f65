They Lions have won their last 10 matches in a row and will only return to action on July 1 when they host the Sunwolves.Ackermann will be keeping his fingers crossed that his players return from Springbok and SA A duty without injuries or fatigue.Ruan Dreyer Jaco Kriel Malcolm Marx Franco Mostert Warren Whiteley Andries Coetzee Ross Cronje Elton Jantjies Courtnall Skosan and Lionel Mapoe are part of the Springbok squad to face France in a three-match series next month.Andries Ferreira Ruan Combrinck and Harold Vorster were included in the SA A squad to be coached by Ackermann during their two matches against the French Barbarians in Durban and Soweto next month. The competition catered for a five-week break " Ackermann said."Some years back it benefited us because guys came back from injuries. But at the moment we have a healthy squad with players fit."We are playing well we have momentum and uncertain times lie ahead with Warren (Whiteley) and a lot of other guys going to have a lot of tough games."Some of the guys are with the SA A side. The Lions have been in devastating form in the last few weeks and they hammered the Kings 54-10 on Sunday. We just hope that they come back injury-free and ready to go " Ackermann said."It is the same for New Zealand sides with the All Blacks having a tough series and for the Australian sides with the Wallabies playing international matches."We have to deal with the situation and if you ask me now it would have been nice just to keep on playing for the next three or four weeks."But that is not in our hands. To be able to deal with the after affects of disruptions by national call-ups Ackermann said they will have to manage the players when they return. If Warren (Whiteley) is going to play all three Test matches and for 80 minutes as captain of the national team then we have to manage him extremely well."We have to look at each and every individual and take it from there."If you refer from the past we did not have any Springboks in the squad and we were fortunate because we were able to plan for the four weeks break. Looking back at the convincing win over the Kings captain Whiteley praised his charges for not losing shape after they lost hooker Robbie Coetzee in the first half to a red card for dangerous play. You could feel that we were one man short because we were under pressure but what we did very well was that we played with intensity."We kept it tight we mauled a lot scummed well and we were direct."When we saw that Robbie (Coetzee) went off we spoke about it and said that we can t commit too much."We have been in that situation before but guys made very good decisions at the breakdowns."I am proud of the mindset of the players because we knew it was going a tough job against them.
