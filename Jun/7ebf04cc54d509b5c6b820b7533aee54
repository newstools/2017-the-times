Death becomes me https://t.co/lBCgEatx8Wvia GIPHY This is not the first time that Trevor has been targeted in a death hoax. In March this year news of his 'death' went viral and left his blind mom in a state of shock. "The worst part of this fake news story reporting that I died, is the fact that my mom, who is blind, had to hear from people calling her and she had to go through all those emotions before being able to get to a phone to call me," he said at the time.
