One of the most common complaints I get from consumers is that they are legitimately owed a refund by a company and they just aren't getting it: a deposit refund from a car rental company, for example, or a refund of an unauthorised debit or some kind of over-charge. Often they've been trying to get the money for months.I try to intervene in as many such cases as I can; I send an e-mail to the company in question and that's usually swiftly followed by an apology to the consumer and a refund.I seldom publish them, these routine, "little" cases - on their own they lack newsworthiness, I reason - but each is a consumer outrage, nonetheless.That people, despite making repeated contact, can't get the money they are rightfully owed from a company without seeking help from the likes of me is shameful. Especially when you consider what happens to us - the little people. But, when we owe these companies money, they have the power to impose penalties, charge interest, hand us over to debt collectors and mess up our credit records.Last week's "pay back the money" cases included that of Gail Walker of Bathurst, Eastern Cape, who cancelled her Absa garage card, in writing, in early September, but the bank continued to charge her a monthly fee for it.For five months she and her husband Lindsay dealt with various Absa staff members - including e-mailing CEO Maria Ramos in early January - trying to put a stop to that debit, but Absa continued.By the time they contacted me, they were owed R144 as a refund. Not a huge amount but, as Walker said: "It's the blatant, unprofessional disregard for the client that upsets me."Within hours of my raising the case with Absa's media team, Walker was refunded."Ms Walker was contacted by our customer care team and was comfortable with the feedback provided," I was told. "A hold was placed on the card to ensure the linked credit card remains open."The matter is being investigated further and the necessary steps will be taken to ascertain why no response was provided to Ms Walker."That didn't quite explain why the card fee continued to be debited all those months, but that was as much of an answer as I could get from the bank.It fascinates me that institutions that charge their customers interest on money they owe them never consider paying interest when the owing is the other way around.A VERY LONG ADMIN BACKLOGThen were was Nothemba Zungu, who, in mid-December, booked and paid for a night's stay - New Year's Eve - at Matt's Rest, a B&amp;B in Pietermaritzburg, via the international site bookings.com.A day later the site contacted her to request that, as the B&amp;B would not have any staff on duty on New Year's Day, she extend her stay by a night so that she could check-out properly.Zungu said that didn't suit her and cancelled the booking. She was assured she'd be refunded her R585 in full."To this day, I'm still battling to get that refund paid to me," she said last week. "I've phoned the B&amp;B more times than I can remember and I have e-mailed booking.com, to no avail."How many more e-mails will I have to send and how many phone calls, at my expense, will I have to make to get this refund saga sorted out?"I sent an e-mail to both the booking site and the B&amp;B and have not had a response from either.But Zungu did. "I got an e-mail from the B&amp;B, saying the refund had been made and that it may take a week to reflect in my account. No reason was given as to why it took so long for the refund to be effected, so I asked."I was told that their accounts department 'had a backlog'.Her payment, bear in mind, was made two-and-a half months ago.Clearly companies prefer the flow of money to happen from their customers to them, rather than the other way round.But if they don't have systems and people in place to ensure that when refunds are due, they are paid promptly, that's a surefire way to undermine their marketing and advertising spend.If you've been waiting for a refund from a company for more than two months, e-mail me the details and I'll do my best to get that money paid back.CONTACT WENDY: Email: consumer@knowler.co.za Twitter: @wendyknowler As honey fans will know, its price has skyrocketed globally, making it the prefect target for adulteration. South African honey is among the best quality in the world, but it meets only 50% of local demand, the rest being imported, much of it low-cost, low-quality honey. So honey brands on our shelves could be misleading to consumers in two ways - by claims to be produced here, when it's actually either 100% imported, often from China, or diluted with inferior imports; or it could be adulterated with syrup.Now, thanks to researchers with Stellenbosch University's food science department, there's a quick, easy, nondestructive, relatively inexpensive way to know whether a honey sample has been made by local or 'foreign' bees and whether it contains cane sugar.If you come across honey which you suspect is not what the label claims it to be, let me know where you bought it and what you paid for it. I'll send it Stellenbosch University to be tested.
