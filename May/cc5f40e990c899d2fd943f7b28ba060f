It keeps new Bafana Bafana coach Stuart Baxter in his current tenure at SuperSport with a second successive cup appearance as they now await either Lamontville Golden Arrows or Orlando Pirates in the June 24 final in DurbanFrom the kick off, SuperSport United looked to stymie their hosts preference for a passing game by employing a high line and strong pressing game, forcing Chippa to have to punt the ball forward which allowed the visitors to dictate the early exchanges with the bulk of possession.But it also left SuperSport vulnerable to counter attacks and after just six minutes Chippa had their first attempt which Andile Mbenyane wasted because of the absence of any confidence in taking a shot with his left foot.Thuso Phala s quick break midway through the first half offered SuperSport a chance but too many touches cost them an opportunity to test Daniel Akpeyi in the Chippa goal.Sandile Zuke s tigerish tackling in the midfield forced an error out of Dean Furman in the 27th minute allowing Chippa to set up another chance to score but Zuke s attempt to chip the ball over the on-rushing Ronwen Williams was disappointingly inaccurate.Dan Malesela s irritation with his team s inability to dictate the game saw him take off midfield general Xolani Mdaki some eight minutes before half-time and replace him with Siyabonga Ngubane.The bruising battle continued through the second half with possession exchanged far too regularly between the two sides to make the game anything of a spectacle.But Thuso Phala should have put SuperSport ahead in the 65th minute when Jeremy Brockie dragged the ball back for him to shoot but he was wide.Brockie had a half volley chance nine minutes from the end of regulation time but also missed the target and just before the 90 minutes were up, and the game went into extra time, there was also half chance for Mandla Masango.Brockie fired twice in on goal right at the start of the added half-hour but Akpeyi saved both before he spilt the ball the ball to offer Masango the best chance of the game that was squandered from close just before extra-time half-time.Phala was set up for another chance as SuperSport dominated the closing stages but he missed with 12 minutes left while Chippa got a rare effort in from Zephania Mbokama that shaved the outside of the post.In the shootout, Ronwen Williams saved the first two Chippa efforts to ensure Clayton Daniels could deliver the coup d grace. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
