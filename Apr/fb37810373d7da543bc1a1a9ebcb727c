This comes after the laptops of three public health officials were confiscated at their homes late on Friday by the city s metro police and internal audit division. Trollip said on Saturday the municipality had identified a number of allegedly irregular payments and invoices. This is particularly in the public health directorate he said.This also resulted in the suspension of a municipal employee late last week which prompted city manager Johann Mettler to retrieve the municipal laptops Trollip said. The new government in Nelson Mandela Bay has already committed to stopping corruption and fraud he said.But the suspension and confiscation of the laptops prompted Bobani to send out a statement on Monday saying he was disgusted by apartheid-style operations in the municipality.This article appeared in The Herald ().TMG Digital/HeraldLIVE
