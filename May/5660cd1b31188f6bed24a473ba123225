The explosion killed 22 people moments after the US pop singer left the stage. It came a year-and- a-half after another assault claimed by the Islamic State group devastated a rock show at the Bataclan in Paris.With extremists looking for maximum public effect, the blast at the Manchester Arena was especially grisly as Grande's fan base is full of young girls, with an eight-year-old among the confirmed victims.The Western world has experienced a decade of soaring growth in live music, far surpassing sales of recordings as the main moneymaker for artists.But share prices of Live Nation, the concert giant behind Grande's tour, slumped by nearly 1% on Tuesday on security jitters after a year in which their value jumped by nearly half.Joe Reinartz, news editor at the live music industry publication Pollstar, said he expected more parents to think twice about taking children to concerts or other crowded places."Right now the answer is it's just too early to tell and nobody has a crystal ball," Reinartz said of the Manchester attack's effect on live music. But he said: "I would say that there would probably be an immediate effect on all public gatherings of a massive size in the near future."Live music is hardly the only target. Recent mass-casualty attacks have included trucks slamming into pedestrians on the Nice promenade and a Berlin Christmas market, and a gun attack inside a gay nightclub in Orlando in the US.James Donio, president of the Music Business Association, a US-based trade group, noted that foolproof security in and around venues was impossible."This is the world we have been living in for a few years," he said. "You cannot say that you're going to have a guarantee of nothing happening or being completely safe, which is sad. We're about keeping the music playing and encouraging people to enjoy what music brings to the world. If that means that has to be balanced with waiting in a longer line to get in, that's part of what we have to do as fans."Young people have been at the forefront of live music's expansion, with summer festivals becoming a rite of passage for millennials of sufficient means.Analytical firm IbisWorld estimates that live music is a $28-billion a year industry in the US alone, with growth averaging 5% annually for the past five years.Security was already stepped up around the world following the Bataclan attack, with major venues setting up control rooms and promoters meticulously sifting through bags - raising questions as to how the Manchester assailant evaded detection.Daniel Colling, director of the 6000-capacity Zenith in Paris, said the concert hall has ramped up both security personnel and screening since the November 2015 assault on Paris."If new attacks hit concert halls, we will have to worry about a reduction in attendance, especially for shows that reach audiences made up of families, the young and foreigners," he said.Michael Dugher, CEO of the industry umbrella group, UK Music, said: "Music has the power to bring people together and is so often a celebration of peace and love. We will not let terrorism and the politics of violence, hatred and division conquer that spirit."
