Q. I'm embarrassed when we make love because of the sound that comes from my vagina. I feel like my vagina is too big for him. What must I do because he says I'm cheating on him. A. During arousal, normal physical changes happen - there is swelling of the labia and the vagina typically shortens, with a bulging of the deep vagina - also known as "tenting" - and a narrowing of the external vagina. This creates conditions in which air can get trapped within and then be forced out during penetration. During sex, the thrusting of the penis or sex toy into the vagina may cause a build-up of air pressure. When this trapped air escapes around the penis or toy, it creates a noise that can sound like the vaginal walls slapping together. These sound effects are not uncommon, and can occur at the peak of arousal and enjoyment, but sometimes they lead to embarrassment. • Try changing position with the penis still in the vagina to decrease air entry. • Decrease the degree to which the penis is removed and reinserted during thrusting. • The volume of the sound caused by escaping air will probably be much lower if the penis is inserted slowly, because this allows the air to exit more slowly. Other factors can contribute to audible air movements within the vagina, including childbirth, prolapse and distortions in the vaginal walls. You will need a complete medical check-up, and if you have significant concerns with the vaginal vault you will need to discuss your options with your healthcare provider. • Dr Tlaleng Mofokeng (MBChB), sexual and reproductive health practice, DISA Clinic, 011-886-2286, visit safersex.co.za.
