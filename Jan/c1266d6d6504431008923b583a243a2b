A poster advertising the awards on social media featured the council logo under the words "host city".But spokeswoman Priya Reddy said the city was not part of the event."The City of Cape Town can confirm that it has no association with this event and neither are we supporting it in any way. We will investigate the unauthorised use of the city's branding," said Reddy.Veronica Modieleng, spokeswoman for event organisers Ngavu Enterprises, said an error had been made. "We are writing a formal apology letter to the City of Cape Town ... we are going to remove the logo," she said.The awards are being held on February 11. The ANC and EFF have said they will not attend."The greatest honour for the ANC is when it is elected," said party spokesman Zizi Kodwa.Political commentators have ridiculed the idea of giving politicians awards.
