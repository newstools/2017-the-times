After their promising display against England on Saturday, the fifth-ranked Proteas were chasing the game from the first quarter, making life difficult for themselves against the Australian side that has been a class above the rest.The Diamonds were clinical and took advantage on many of the occasions the Proteas made errors, particularly in front of goals where the hosts missed tons of opportunities to close a gap that kept on increasing.The Australians took a 17-9 lead in the first quarter, sending out a clear message that they were out to get a big score.Backed by a good crowd, the South Africans showed glimpses of brilliance but that will be overshadowed by their inability to take chances when they were presented.Proteas coach Norma Plummer made some changes in the second quarter, bringing on Lindie Lombard, Precious Mthembu and Zanele Vimbela.After making an impact against England, the crowd expected a lot from Lombard but the Australian defence neutralised her. Vimbela did not make an impact while Mthembu was not as affective as she was against England.By the end of the first half, Australia were 11 goals ahead of the South Africans. They were just warming up, as that lead was increased to 15 goals at the end of the third quarter..A 15 goal deficit going into the second half would not be easy to turn over. Despite showing good fighting spirit in an attempt to make a comeback, the Proteas were just weaker than their opponents and ended up losing 62-46. Experience proved to be key for Australia in this victory.The Proteas, meanwhile, will be travelling to England for the fourth leg of the quad series this weekend. - TMG Digital
