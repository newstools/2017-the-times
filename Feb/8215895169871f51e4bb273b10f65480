This past weekend, however, a disconcerting conversation occurred between a friend and me. More on that later.Anyway, a few hours after Serena had claimed her 23rd grand slam singles title, I posted a memorable quote by the late tennis icon Arthur Ashe which encapsulated my feelings after last Saturday's all-Williams final in Melbourne, Australia."One day, I think not too far in the distant future, there will be many, many more black tennis players playing. and they won't talk like me and they won't look like me and they won't dress like me and they're going to upset a whole lot of people," said Ashe back in 1979.Ashe was the first African-American man to be ranked as the number one tennis player in the world. He remains the only black man to win the Wimbledon, US Open and Australian Open titles. Ashe's rivals included Jimmy Connors (who he famously defeated in the 1975 Wimbledon final) and Bj rn Borg.In 2017 Venus and Serena still pose the only threat to the establishment.One might argue that they are now the establishment, having accumulated all their accolades, but the fact is they came in as outsiders. Despite their triumphs, they remain divisive figures; they're (still) mocked for their physiques and have been unfairly blamed for "killing" tennis by playing on for so long (Venus is 36 and Serena is 35).Ashe correctly predicted that whoever the next black stars would be, they would be met with resistance, repulsion and racism.So it is understandable that black people have rallied around them at every tournament, especially the grand slams and proudly flooded social media expressing their pride at their every win - including magazine covers, new business ventures and, in the case of the younger sister, an engagement to businessman Alexis Ohanian (the subject of the disagreement between my friend and me).Between them the sisters have amassed 30 grand slam singles titles and more than $120-million in prize money.They ruffled feathers and beat some of the biggest names in the women's game, including Martina Hingis, Lindsay Davenport, Steffi Graf, Monica Seles, Kim Clijsters, Justine Henin-Hardenne and Maria Sharapova.It was almost as if they were expected to be grateful to be playing against these players and for being a part of the Women's Tennis Association. Thankfully, they were made of more resilient stuff and were unapologetic about their talent and their mission. Indeed, they were at the forefront of the fight for equal prize money in the sport.It is not inconceivable that today's crop of black tennis players, be it Sloane Stevens of the US or even Frenchmen Ga l Monfils and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, were inspired, in some part, to take up the sport because of Venus and Serena.They charted a path the rest have since followed. Growing up, they were our only references - they were proof that nothing was out of bounds. At a time when black lives appear as perilous as ever, they exude fearlessness. They were and remain our hope.But, you see, my friend prompted our disagreement by putting a dampener on the festive feeling by expressing his "disappointment" at Serena's engagement to a white man.He took exception to Ohanian "picking, like they always do, our best". He wanted to see a wealthy white man fall in love with an ordinary black woman, "not just the world number one".Our affinity to the sisters, and other celebrities for that matter, has given us a false sense of entitlement to their personal lives.I felt he had no business speaking as if Serena had no say in who she chose to marry, as if a pistol had been held to her head and a decision coerced out of her.I also hated that many other black men on Twitter felt betrayed by Serena for not choosing rappers Common or Drake, both of whom she famously dated.They almost suggested that her outspokenness on racism and civil rights was, in hindsight, disingenuous and void.Rubbish.She was not "stolen" from us, and those who feel so should deal with their inadequacies privately.As much as the Williams sisters are paid to entertain us, they're not obliged to listen to us - and that's what they should remember the next time a troll questions their choices.Not that they need me to tell them. They have made their careers from going against society's expectations.
