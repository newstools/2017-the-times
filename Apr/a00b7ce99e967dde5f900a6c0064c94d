The KZN health department confirmed yesterday that the syndicate, which largely operated out of Newcastle, was bust by police. Health MEC Sibongiseni Dhlomo said a local taxi boss was colluding with department employees to "strip off ambulance parts and fit them into taxis".The taxi boss was arrested and three taxis impounded, the department confirmed. One of the taxis, when impounded, was loaded with passengers en route to Swaziland for the Easter break. The man was allegedly targeting the department's VW Crafter ambulances, whose parts were fitted into his 22-seater buses.Dhlomo said: "It is really very painful that an employee who rose through the ranks to become a head of section is the one responsible for this misery that results in the shortage of ambulances. I have decided to hold a meeting on Tuesday next week with all the districts' Emergency Medical Service's heads. I want them to give an explanation as to how these fairly new ambulances end up requiring replacement of gearboxes, tyres, starters and other parts that are supposed to have a longer lifespan."The taxi boss is expected to appear in court today.
