"The number of schools that we have can accommodate the number of learners that we have but the problem is choice he said.He added that it is also that some schools are not performing so parents are voting based on where it is they feel their children can have a better education".The MEC held a media briefing at the province s offices in Johannesburg where he detailed the new additions to the online school system that will be launching on May 2 at 8.30am and will be open until midnight on June 12.Speaking to TMG Digital Lesufi detailed some of the areas in Gauteng in need of schools. Areas such as Pretoria North Montana side definitely need schools. There the challenge is that there are enough schools in that area but they are predominantly Afrikaans-speaking schools. Then you move to areas such as Centurion and you have the same problem. You ve got enough schools but the problem is language .He also made mention of areas in the Midrand to Bryanston corridor which starts from Midrand and moves down to Woodmead Sandton and Bryanston. There you just need complete new schools because of the population explosion there your townhouses and new developments. Then from the Monte Casino area and move up until Clearwater you need lots and lots of schools because of the issue of new development and housing. The South of Johannesburg is also a problem area says Lesufi especially from Naturena towards The Glen shopping mall in Oakdene.He also said that there is a backlog of 300 schools with a new school opening every month.Lesufi also says that the department is looking to open 18 specialised schools in total in the province which will specialise in areas such as engineering aviation agriculture and the arts. My belief is that you shouldn t need to go to university we must be able to equip you with skills in high school so that you can go and get a job when you re done with school at that level he said.
