The two Umzimkhulu councillors who survived the apparent hit that left ANC councillor and former ANCYL secretary general Sindiso Magaqa dead were finally due to tell their story at the Moerane Commission into political violence in KZN. The two‚ Jabulile Msiya and Nontsikelelo Mafa‚ who were hospitalised after the vehicle they and Magaqa were sitting in was riddled with AK-47 bullets in July‚ were set to testify at the commission starting on Wednesday. Joining them will be Magaqa's friend‚ Les Stuta‚ commission secretary Solo Mdledle told TimesLIVE. Mafa‚ a Ward 11 councillor‚ is still on crutches due to injuries sustained during the shooting. Msiya‚ who is a Ward 16 councillor and a member of the Umzimkhulu municipality's executive committee alongside the late Magaqa‚ was due to testify first. Both were expected to speak in isiXhosa through an interpreter. The three arrived under heavy police guard. Reporters who were filming their arrival were harshly ordered by police officers to stop taking pictures and videos. One police officer demanded that the TimesLIVE reporter at the commission delete the footage. This is a developing story and will be updated.
