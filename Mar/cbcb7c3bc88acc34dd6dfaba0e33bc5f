The league's provincial spokesman Siyabulela Tom appeared in court on Thursday for calling a police officer a "p**s" and assaulting another at a roadblock in Sea Point.Tom is facing three charges of assault and crimen injuria after his arrest last year.He has pleaded not guilty to the charges. He has instead launched a counter-claim against the police. Tom alleged that an officer called him a "bobbejaan" (baboon) before he was taken into custody.Tom has also lodged a complaint of racism against the officer with the South African Human Rights Commission.However City of Cape Town senior traffic officer Jeremy Minnie told the court that Tom appeared intoxicated on the day. He swore at members of his team and later slapped him on the chest.Minnie said Tom also stood in the middle of the road blocking traffic and boasted that he is an ANC member and "we will see what will happen to us".Tom said Minnie was in the passenger's seat when the driver of the vehicle was arrested. The driver refused to blow into a breathalyzer.Minnie alleged that Tom got out of the car and started speaking to the driver in isiXhosa but later shouted at the officers accusing an SAPS officer of calling him a "bobbejaan".When Minnie allegedly refused to give Tom the officer's name the ANC member started hurling insults at Minnie."[He told me]: 'F*** you you coloured and white people think that you are in charge. You p**es!'" said Minnie.He said Tom shouted at another SAPS officer daring him to take out his gun and shoot because "that s what you guys are good for".Minnie said he it was the first time in his 16 year career that this had happened to him."I felt intimidated I felt hurt. I am in charge of 10 members [and] as a supervisor I felt humiliated " he said.However advocate Nicholas Madolo who is representing Tom told the court during that Tom only approached police when an officer asked him to translate for his driver.He said this was because the driver could not understand Minnie s instructions. However said Madolo when Tom did as he was told he was instructed to move away and called a baboon by the SAPS officer.The case continues. - TMG Digital/The Times
