Anilia Van Niekerk Graaf told TMG Digital that she deeply regrets what she did and said she was being tormented and harassed. That place is a dump. One bedroom at the back in the k***er s erf she wrote in the message intended for a friend.My cousin just sent me this. This white lady viewed her friend's cottage and sent him this by mistake.

I'm so tired of white people wow pic.twitter.com/FXCmNKRtySThe message was shared generating a swift backlash on social media. Her phone began ringing off the hook. Immediately after I sent the message people started to harass me and it has been non-stop ever since. I was threatened that I would lose my job she said. I apologised to the person I accidently sent the message to and I apologised to some of the people who harassed me. But the threats have become so intense that she is considering opening a case of harassment.
