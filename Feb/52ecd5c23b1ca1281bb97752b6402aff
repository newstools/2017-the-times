The incident witnessed by TMG Digital photographer Jackie Clausen took place along Kassier Road Hillcrest west of Durban. Clausen was on her way to the start of the final day of the Dusi Canoe Marathon when the accident took place. "He literally overtook me and all the cars in the queue and nearly had a head-on in front of me. An ongoing driver almost hit two pedestrians walking on the sidewalk while trying to avoid him. It was inevitable that just a couple of hundred metres down the road he could eventually crash " she said. It appeared that the driver first fled the scene but Rescue Care paramedic Garrith Jamieson said the man was reportedly in Metro Police custody."Two people collided and a total of four people sustained minor to moderate injuries. There were no serious injuries on the scene. Traffic was severely affected " he said.TMG Digital/TimesLIVE
