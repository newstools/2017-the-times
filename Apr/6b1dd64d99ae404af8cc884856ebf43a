That is the view of We are South Africans a group which has been granted permission by the London Metropolitan Police to protest outside of the company s offices in the UK on Saturday.The company has been accused of running an underhanded deflection campaign for the Gupta family which hired them in 2016 using social media that proved to be racially divisive in South Africa. The campaign portrayed the Gupta family as victims of white minority capital .Bell Pottinger confirmed they had parted ways with the Guptas on Wednesday saying the company had become the target of a politically-driven smear campaign in South Africa.We are South Africans protest organiser Justin Eden said in a statement that the UK company had caused immense racial division in our country that ordinary people had to mend . Based on the State of Capture report by previous Public Protector Advocate Thuli Madonsela it is clear that monies paid to Bell Pottinger's could have been obtained through irregular tenders known or unknown alleged or not. We therefore calmly urge Bell Pottinger to donate the money they have received from Oakbay Investments and affiliated companies to the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund as reparation for the damages they have caused the South African people as well as the South African economy said the statement.Although the PR firm had cut ties with Gupta company Oakbay Investments the protest will go ahead outside the company in Holborn on Saturday.
