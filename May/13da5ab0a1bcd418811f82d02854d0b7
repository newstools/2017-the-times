Courtney Peters has been missing since Thursday and MEC for Social Development Albert Fritz called on the public to work with officers at the Elsies River police station to help find her. The recent incidents of missing or abducted children child abuse and murders reveal that for some of our children life isn t as care-free and safe as it should be Fritz said in a statement. DSD has a zero-tolerance approach to any form of harm and abuse of child and the Children s Act of 2005 enjoins us all to place the best interests of children first. The department has vowed to support the family of the missing toddler by providing the necessary counselling.Last week 13 people were shot at Elsies River - three succumbed to their injuries. The situation has become so volatile that Minister of Police Fikile Mbalula visited the area last week to interact with residents and victims' families.Earlier this year the body of 13-year-old Rene Tracy Roman was discovered in Lavender Hill and the body of 11-year-old Stacha Arendse was found in an open field in Mitchells Plain.
