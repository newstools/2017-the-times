The Knysna Provincial Hospital was one of the structures which was ablaze as raging fires continued to spread through the Western Cape, a local resident told TimesLive. The fire began on the one side but is now spreading to the other side of the town and the hospital is on fire. Basically the whole town is burning, said Ivo Vegter.Earlier, Vegter had taken to Twitter where he explained the catastrophe. Knysna is burning down. This is a disaster of epic proportions. I'm stuck in fleeing traffic. Not sure I'll have a home tomorrow, he tweeted.Knysna is burning down. This is a disaster of epic proportions. I'm stuck in fleeing traffic. Not sure I'll have a home tomorrow.Massive evacuations were currently underway. The highways are closed in both directions but there is traffic inside the city as people are trying to make their way to the islands, said Vegter.He was headed to the nearby Leisure Island.While parts of Cape Town were earlier battered by a heavy storm, Vegter said there was no rain in sight in the Knysna area. We are only expecting rain tomorrow and even that won t be enough to contain this. We are in deep deep trouble, he added.
