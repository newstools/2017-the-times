He is a visiting professor at nearby Stanford University.Toledo issued a statement on Twitter, without revealing his whereabouts, denying he was on the run because he had not been facing charges when he left Peru."The court in Lima did not request my testimony to help with their investigation."On the contrary, it accused me of crimes that I have not committed and that the court cannot prove," he said.Toledo has branded the accusations against him as political persecution. But he has struggled to explain the source of the money.
