The police were called to Pick n Pay Clothing at the Mall at Reds on Monday after the dog's doodoo landed its owner in an awkward position.The police told the dog's owner to clean up the mess.Legogang Nldovu, who works at the store, explained how it all went down."The dog came running into the store and made a mess on the floor," she said."Then two ladies came in and wanted to take the dog, but the dog does not belong to them."Ndlovu said the owner of the dog was nowhere in sight."I told them they could not take the dog if it did not belong to them. They said they wanted to take the little dog to a vet."Ndlovu said a man arrived and spoke to one of the women in Afrikaans. Ndlovu was then told that they were taking the dog to a vet and she would have to clean up the mess.The man used extremely vulgar language, according to Ndlovu, and told her she would lose her job because she was lazy and incapable."They took the dog so I called security, who called the police," Ndlovu said.In the confusion, the owner of the animal arrived.Ndlovu said the dog's owner apologised, but refused to mop up the poop. "She told me she had locked the dog in the car and left the window open."Carmed Reddy, who co-presents the Hamman Time show on 5FM, witnessed some of the altercation and spoke about it on air."I didn't witness the entire thing but I was walking past and noticed the policemen with a lady and her dog outside the store and went closer to check out what was happening," Reddy said."It was a lady with her little dog and a child and the dog messed the floor and the cops were called in and they forced her to clean it up."She was extremely upset by this. The store provided her with a mop and she cleaned it before leaving."
