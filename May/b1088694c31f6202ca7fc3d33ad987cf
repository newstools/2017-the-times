But in order to have any chance Chiefs must keep up their winning record against mercurial Lamontville Golden Arrows, whom they host tomorrow at FNB Stadium.Chiefs have won their past five meetings between the two clubs and only ever lost three times in 24 previous meetings with the Durban outfit.That makes them easy favourites, but dropping points in their last two league games has vastly reduced their chances of claiming the title.After tomorrow's match Chiefs will have just three games left and have 12 points available to them in all.Should they take them all they will finish on 58 points.Ordinarily, that would not be enough to take the title, but both Bidvest Wits and Mamelodi Sundowns, who sit above them in the standings, have tough fixtures still to play in the closing stages of the campaign.This should be a game to get Chiefs back on track, but Arrows can be an obstinate team.It must be remembered that the last time Arrows were in Gauteng for a major match they upset Sundowns at Loftus Versfeld in the Nedbank Cup.The game is M5 in our Soccer 6 pool of the pick. Let's look at the rest:M1 Chippa United v Ajax Cape Town: Chippa play a second game since Dan Malesela was removed as coach and have now gone 11 league games without a win, dropping to just one point above the relegation places. Ajax are now chasing a top-eight place after beating Platinum Stars 2-0 at home on Sunday, lifting them clear of the danger zone.M2 Atletico Madrid v Eibar: After Tuesday's mauling at the hands of Cristiano Ronaldo and Real Madrid, Atletico seek a victory to consolidate third place in La Liga and a Champions League slot for next season again. Eibar have lost just once on their previous away trips.M3 Polokwane City v SuperSport United: Polokwane City are seeking a fourth successive win as they sit firmly in a club-high sixth place, despite tumult in recent months over their coaching situation. SuperSport lost 4-1 on their last trip to Polokwane City but won two in a row before that.M4 Barcelona v Villarreal: Juventus' stubborn defence eliminated Barcelona from the European Champions League, but the Catalans have won three successive La Liga games and scored 13 goals. Villarreal have not had success in their last 17 meetings against Barcelona stretching back to 2008.M6 Granada v Real Madrid: Granada have picked up a single point out of a possible 30 from their last 10 La Liga games and have been relegated. Real share top place with Barca with three games to go.
