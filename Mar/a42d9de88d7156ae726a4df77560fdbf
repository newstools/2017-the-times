The smiling woman, known only as Annie, was booked into jail by the Police in the eastern Dutch town of Nijmegen-Zuid. According to ABC news, she landed in jail because of her niece, who told the cops that she wanted to tick "experience a police cell from within" off of her bucket list. The 99-year-old had always wanted to go to jail, but had never gotten around to doing anything to earn her place there. "In her life she never committed any crime, and thought it would be exciting to experience. As you can see in the picture from our post, she found it hilarious to be in the inside with the handcuffs," Peter Smit, a lieutenant at the police station, told the UK's Independent. Pictures posted to the police station's Facebook page show exactly how happily Annie accepted jail life, at least for one night.Jail'You get many unusual requests with this profession. We thought it would be nice to do something special for Annie,' one of the police officers at the station told The Daily Mail.
