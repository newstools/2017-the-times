The story alluded to attorneys Michael Murphy the Premier Soccer League s head of legal and Farai Razano as being employed by law firm ENSAfrica. This was erroneous. TMG has now been informed that Murphy and Raziano left ENSAfrica six months ago and are now employed by Murphys Attorneys. The error has been corrected in the story. TMG and its reporter Marc Strydom deeply regret the error.
