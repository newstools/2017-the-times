Bok and Blue Bulls legend Van der Westhuizen died on Monday after a long battle with motor neuron disease (MND).He was 45. Since a young age Joost was determined to reach the highest height. We did not take him seriously when he started talking about that dream but he worked very hard to achieve that dream Pieter van Westhuizen said at the memorial service at Loftus Versfeld on Friday.Joost van der Westhuizen s sibling added that the dream of making it big on the international stage seemed almost impossible to achieve considering the fact that theirs was a normal family living on the outskirts of Pretoria.junk We were just a normal family with not much but strong values that were learned from our parents but he took it upon himself to play for the Springboks and he worked extremely hard to achieve that dream and he put our family on the map. He was a proud Blue Bulls and Springbok and he was proud to be a South African. He was our brother a father and a son and he performed those roles with pride. He loved his children very much. Pieter van der Westhuizen explained the heartache the family felt when his brother was diagnosed with MND and when it became clear that the disease had no cure. It was difficult for us when he got sick because we did not know what MND was and initially we thought he would get better he said.junk We realised that there was no cure for the disease which makes you a prisoner in your own body he said adding that being a celebrity largely robbed his brother of privacy during his illness.Joost van der Westhuizen was buried in a simple coffin and Pieter said that was what the rugby star wanted. He wanted to go away a simple man and in a simple coffin and I honour him for that. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
