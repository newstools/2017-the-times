Two men were arrested around 3:40am after an attempted break-in at a house in Greenside. One of them managed to escape but later died after he drowned at Johannesburg's Zoo Lake. "The deceased is one of the two suspects that were arrested in the early hours of the morning after attempting to break into a house in Greenside [at] around 3 o'clock in the morning " said Parkview police spokesperson Captain Tintswalo Sibeko. "On their arrival at the police station the suspect was handcuffed and [then] the police removed the handcuffs so that he could sign the notice of his rights but he jumped out and ran away. One of the police officers who tried to apprehend him tripped and injured his right leg " added Sibeko. The police official was taken for medical attention for the injuries sustained during the escape. The suspect then ran towards Zoo Lake where he went straight into the water. The police pleaded with him to come out but he refused Sibeko said. She added that after some time the officers lost sight of the suspect and contacted police divers for assistance. They discovered the body of a 23-year-old man who is yet to be named at around 8 am. Paramedics certified him dead on the scene. Police are still investigating.- TMG Digital
