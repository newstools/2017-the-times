The skin sensors currently used generate false alarms about 90% of the time, most often triggered by the baby's movements."This is a source of discomfort for the babies, because we have to check them every time there's an alarm," Jean-Claude Fauchere, a doctor at University Hospital Zurich's neonatal clinic, said."[False alarms are] a significant stress factor for nurses and a poor use of their time - they distract them from managing real emergencies."University Hospital Zurich is preparing to test a new, contactless monitoring system created by researchers at the EPFL polytechnic university, in Lausanne, and at the Swiss Centre for Electronics and Microtechnology, in Neuchatel.The system will allow premature babies being kept warm in incubators to be monitored by highly sensitive cameras. The system us capable of monitoring a baby's pulse rate by analysing skin colour, which changes minutely with every heart beat."Breathing is monitored by measuring movements of the baby's thorax and shoulders."At night infrared cameras take over, so monitoring is non-stop." the university said.
