947 radio presenter Karabo Ntshweng has spoilt herself with a new ride, a BMW 1 series worth nearly half a million rand. The former YOtv presenter took to Instagram on Friday to show off her new set of wheels. According to BMW South Africa, the 1 series ranges from R410,000 to R540,000. The purchase comes just over a year after the star bought herself a Mini Cooper for her 25th birthday.
