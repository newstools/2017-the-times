Speaking to The Times Kloof resident Alain Rijnvis said that he acted out of instinct when he armed himself with a chair and took on the home invader in the early hours of Tuesday morning. The 44-year-old who was stabbed in the forehead and arm in the fracas recounted the moment he fought for his family. I don t sleep at night so I sit at my computer and I play games. I have three daughters one is an infant and sometimes they get restless. I heard a noise so I got up to go and check on them he said from his hospital bed. While walking through the kitchen there I saw a guy hunched over trying to hide below the kitchen counters. I let out this roar to try and alert my wife who was sleeping in bed near the baby Rijnvis said.The homeowner said the man had lunged at him with a kitchen knife stabbing him in the forehead. I ran around the breakfast area and in the fray he dropped the knife. I picked up a chair and started wailing on him. He somehow managed to get his hands on another knife and I could feel him stabbing me he said. I heard a bash and there was another guy outside who was trying to break his way in to help his friend. He was using the furniture outside to break through our glass door. As the two grappled Rijnvis said the safety of his wife and children was foremost in his mind. I was trying to get him out the house so I could protect my family. I don t know how I did it but I managed to push to him out the hole that his friend was making in the window. I was ready to take them on again if the came back he said. There was blood everywhere and it looked terrible. It all happened so quickly and I am so happy it turned out the way it did. My wife and my girls are safe.
