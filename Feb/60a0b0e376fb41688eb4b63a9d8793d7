Government's official communications channel GCIS hosted public protector advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane for a question and answer session earlier on Monday.However what was supposed to be an informative session saw the hashtag #AskThePublicProtector soon become a source of amusement for South African twitter.While GCIS tweeted useful information such as the public protector's toll free line and some of the challenges she faced in office twitter users saw it appropriate to make fun of the situation.One twitter user tweeted a picture of ANC Secretary General Gwede Mantashe asking where he got his suit tailored. Who is Uncle Gwede's tailor? #AskThePublicProtector pic.twitter.com/SbPiSg9pWBWhile another user asked if Shaka Sisulu who had been implicated in the ANC social media war room stories ever produced evidence about the money he received.#AskThePublicProtectorWill Shaka ever produce the receipts regarding the R50 million as he said? pic.twitter.com/gSnyadw3or Other twitter users wanted the public protector to investigate last week's tropical storm Dineo which wreaked havoc on Mozambique's coast but faded when it reached South Africa.Investigate why #DINEO didn't go to nkandla?#AskThePublicProtectorDo we really deserve #Dineo while we stiil have JZuma mara? investigate pls #AskThePublicProtector#AskThePublicProtector....can you investigate why the cyclone is called Dineo not Patjutju phela that thing is dangerous like patjutjuDoes Dineo Know that there is a place called Nkandla? #AskThePublicProtectorWhile GCIS's intention was for the country to get to know the public protector and her office other users wanted to know if she planned on investigating the announcement of Orlando Pirate's new coach.#AskThePublicProtector Why is the coach of Orlando pirates trending before 6?
