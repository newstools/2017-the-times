It also had 36 139 bachelor passes the second highest in the country. We have produced good results but also ensured access to education more so than any other part of the country. We are generally pleased while we acknowledge there is a vast room for improvement " said Zikalala who is acting on behalf of Premier Willies Mchunu.Zikalala said that the results also had to be looked at in the context of the poverty-stricken and rural nature of the province. We're dealing with the disastrous affects of bantu education. Not so long ago in 1982 the apartheid government spent R1211 on education for each white child and R140 for each black child. The quality of teaching staff also differed. Matric results must be seen from where we come from. These results are a practical barometer of if we are progressing or regressing. And I can say we are progressing. We want to state that the ANC government has recorded massive achievements since 1994 in transforming the education system since our apartheid past " he said.To check your results visit http://matric.sowetanlive.co.za/ TMG Digital/The Times
