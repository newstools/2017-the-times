Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport shut to all domestic and international flights from midnight (2300 GMT Tuesday), pending the start of long overdue work to resurface its potholed runway.An Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 787 from Addis Ababa, which ordinarily would have landed in Abuja, instead touched down in Kaduna, some 190 kilometres to the north.Fire service tenders gave a traditional water-cannon salute as it taxied to a standstill on the apron. Passengers said the landing was hitch-free.Ethiopian Airlines is the only foreign carrier to switch routes to Kaduna. Others, including British Airways, Air France, Lufthansa, Turkish Airlines and South African Airways, have all declined to do so.Kaduna's ability to handle long-haul flights is understood to be behind the decision, as was safety for passengers and staff forced to travel by road between the two cities.But Aviation Minister Hadi Sirika told reporters shortly after the first flight arrived: "There are quite a few doubting Thomases whether Kaduna can work. Kaduna is working."The other airlines were now "probably regretting" their decision, he said, adding that he hoped they would change their minds.An AFP reporter at Kaduna airport said security in and around the facility was tight, although work on parts of the new terminal building had not finished.One international passenger headed for Rome, who gave his name only as Giovanni, described the building as "a work in progress"."They are painting the wall, they are cleaning the door, they are moving the seats... the work should have been completed two days to the opening," he said.Giovanni said it took him more than two hours to get to Kaduna from Abuja by coach but he said: "I have not seen any problem on the road. The road is good, well-paved and large."Ubong Ambrose, another passenger, complained about the deafening noise from contactors working on the VIP lounge and the fact that his ticket was handwritten instead of issued electronically."Apart from that everything is as seen in other airports," he added before catching his flight to Canada.Outside the airport, electricians erected solar-powered lights on the approach road, which was lined with armed police and soldiers.One local businessman, who gave his name only as Ibrahim, said he hoped the temporary transfer of activity would bring a long-term boost."I hope this decision will bring more development to Kaduna and the airlines will maintain the Kaduna route after the six-week period," he added.Sirika pledged that work at Abuja airport would be completed on time and flights would resume in six weeks.The Abuja runway was built in 1982 with a 20-year lifespan. The aviation ministry has described it as "dilapidated" and "unsafe", leaving no option but to resurface.
