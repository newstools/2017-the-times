It knew in 2013 that it had to find an alternative way to pay social grants following a court ruling.Updated court papers submitted on Thursday to Constitutional Court detail how the South Africa Social Security Agency (Sassa) knew months ago that it would have a crisis on its hands but difference in opinions hamstrung the department for months. In October last year the department obtained a legal opinion from advocates Wim Trengrove SC Susannah Cowen Mkhululi Stubbs and Hannine Drake. Department of Social Development on the social grants debacle by SundayTimesZA on Scribd The lawyers make it clear that Sassa needed to find a solution urgently and then declare that solution to the Constitutional Court Treasury and the auditor general.The legal opinion says a renewal of the CPS contract would definitely be unlawful but might be the only solution to the crisis. We are told that Sassa does not have any choice but to enter into an interim arrangement with CPS the legal opinion says.The CPS contract which was declared invalid by the Constitutional Court in 2013 is only in operation because the court suspended its declaration of invalidity to allow the department and Sassa to find a new solution.Since the 2013 judgment Sassa s plan to create an in-house system has fallen flat.In a report submitted to the court on Thursday the agency explains that it had taken advice from a group of technical advisers. The minister and Sassa have since been advised that the plan was overly optimistic unrealistic and underpinned by insufficient research. Sassa was so advised by its technical advisers between August and October 2016 the report says.It is clear from the court papers that much time was wasted since the department received the legal opinion in October 2016.It advised the agency to minimise the duration of an unlawful arrangement with CPS after March 31 expiry of the existing extension of the illegal contract.The legal opinion advises Sassa to find an acceptable way to legalise the payment of social grants on a satisfactory basis as soon as possible .It also advises that Sassa without delay report to the Treasury the auditor general and the Constitutional Court. We suggest that Sassa makes these disclosures without delay so that those to whom the disclosures are made have an opportunity to object and propose alternatives if they have any before Sassa commits itself to the interim arrangement with CPS the legal opinion says.Yet four months later the agency has only just begun negotiations with CPS it has now told the Constitutional Court.Although it began putting out feelers from new bidders in December it only intends publishing a request for proposals from bidders by March 17.Despite the legal opinion advising Sassa to talk to Treasury without delay court papers show that the chief executive only wrote to Treasury Director General Lungile Fuzile on February 7 last year to request approval to deviate from the normal competitive bidding process. In short Treasury did not accept Sassa s explanation for its position and expressed concern about the perpetuation of unlawfulness and constitutionality in the face of the Constitutional Court s decisions. The letter advised that National Treasury would not support the extension of the unlawful CPS contract unless the Constitutional Court further extended the suspension of its invalidity beyond 31 March 2017 the department says.The follow-up report says Treasury also advised that Sassa should have requested a deviation to advertise a new tender for a short period in December 2016 or early January 2017 to avoid a self-created emergency .Sassa admits that it began negotiations with CPS on March 1 just a month before the contract is due to expire. The difference in opinions and delays in resolving different views have in turn delayed forging and implementing a clear path since October 2016 when Sassa received the legal advice Formal negotiations with CPS which have now commenced we delayed in part for this reason. The minister and Sassa accept that the formal negotiations ought to have commenced at an earlier stage the report says.It appears the differences in opinion have not been resolved the department submitted papers to the court this week and then withdrew them.In the report signed by Minister Bathabile Dlamini and acting chief executive Thamo Mzombe the department says the application filed at the court on Tuesday was not authorised. The application was filed without the authorisation of the acting CEO of the minister who should have been but were not consulted beforehand. Once aware of the decision the minister instructed Sassa to withdraw the application. At the time of the filing of this report the circumstances of the filing of the application are still being investigated by the minister and Sassa the department has told the court.
