The Belgian will take the reigns from caretaker-coaches John Maduka and Lehlohonolo Seema.Eymael who resigned as Polokwane City coach on Thursday will be in Rustenburg to watch Celtic take on minnows Buya Msuthu in their Nedbank Cup last-32 clash on Saturday but he will not be on the bench as he awaits a work permit. I am happy to join the team of such incredible stature with massive support. When I first arrived in the country I somehow had a soft spot for the team purely because of the passion and dedication displayed by their supporters Eymael said. I share the same thirst to win. My philosophy is simple to play good football with appropriate tactical discipline. I have watched the team before and have seen some exceptionally good players that just need guidance and encouragement to start winning again. Celtic are struggling in 13th place in the PSL.The Free State club held a press conference at their offices in Bloemfontein on Friday morning to address other issues relating to the club but they could not confirm Eymael s arrival at the time as he was still negotiating terms with lawyers of the club.Celtic s lawyer Mandla Tshabalala said Eymael agreed on a deal just after lunch time on Friday. I met with Eymael in Johannesburg on Friday morning with his representatives to discuss our interest in him and after an open meeting we agreed just after lunch and he committed towards joining the team Tshabalala said.- TMG Digital/TMG Sport
