Pirates will be under the tutelage of new coach Kjell Jonevret in just the Swede's second game in Saturday's 161st Soweto derby at FNB Stadium.Komphela said he does not believe a new coach for the Pirates players to adjust to can somehow work to Chiefs' advantage.Amakhosi's coach said he expects Bucs having had so little time to work under Jonevret since his appointment last week to revert mostly to what they know in the pressure cauldron of the derby. You can t take advantage. Orlando Pirates remain Orlando Pirates. Orlando Pirates won t change Komphela said. You remember when Pirates were campaigning in Africa - they were just hot during that time of Eric Tinkler. They would hit on the transition like nobody. Nothing has changed since then. Yes there have been a few inclusions. But Mpho Maklola is still there [Tendai] Ndoro is still Ndoro [Thabo] Matlaba is still Matlaba. So it doesn't make much difference. Yes the coach has come and from the submissions he's been making he's been talking about organisation organisation. You know how the Europeans are. They are big on defensive organisation and also structuring the team going forward. How quickly can the Pirates players grasp that and if they have if the seed is planted how long can it last through a match? Because as soon as pressure mounts fatigue kicks in then you get to the natural habit of instinct. When instinct kicks in then the Pirates we know will always come out - and not the coach's Pirates. Fourth-placed Chiefs on 34 points from 19 games need a win in the derby against 10th-placed Pirates to remain in contention for the league title race. - TMG DigitalTMG Sport
