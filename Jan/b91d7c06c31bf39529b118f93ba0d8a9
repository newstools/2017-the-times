Dineo is True Love magazine's cover girl and said that she feels blessed to have the musician in her life."In my eyes he's the perfect partner. He isn't freaked about by the illusion people have created of me that I'm high maintenance. He was an accountant when we met and when he wanted to move into music, I was fully supportive."Aw!The pair have often given us couple goals with their glam red carpet snaps. Obvs, it's not just about the fancy life.A photo posted by Dineo Moeketsi (@dineomoeketsi) on Jan 7, 2017 at 4:03pm PST "We are a team and that's the core of our relationship.
