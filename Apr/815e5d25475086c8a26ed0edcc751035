The 20 year-old scored 565 runs at an average of 51.36 that included two centuries during the Sunfoil Series.He also earned a man-of-the match of 161 off 123 balls in the Momentum One Day Cup final in his breakthrough campaign last season.After helping the Titans to beat the Warriors by 236 runs in the Momentum One Day final last month Proteas ODI captain AB de Villiers and Titans coach Mark Boucher waxed lyrically about him saying he must be given an opportunity in the national team. The numbers are there to back him up and the selectors must find a place for him in the national team said De Villiers.He has taken another step towards Proteas selection with his maiden SA A call-up.Eye-catching performances against the England Lions may see him push harder for Proteas selection. If you look at him he has done very well on the franchise level and every player who is picked for SA A is good enough to play for South Africa."For most of these players that are in the SA A longer format squad it is a trial for them and anyone who does well gives us more options said Proteas convener of selectors Linda Zondi. When you look at how well he (Markram) has done it just gives us that confidence."We have given him the opportunity to captain the SA A side and he has never captained even one franchise team."We have known him from the Under-19 team he is one guy who offers you that leadership quality. The SA A four day side has far more experienced players like Heino Kuhn Temba Bavuma Dane Piedt Khaya Zondo and Beuran Hendricks but Zondi said their selection will benefit the Proteas in the long run. It is one of those selection decisions that we were not shy to make as a panel and we believe that it will benefit the Proteas set-up in the future."Every player who is there in the ODI or longer format in the SA A side is good enough to be picked for the Proteas. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
