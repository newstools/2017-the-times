Although Zuma steered away from talking about politics rather focusing on the agenda for the day those calling for him to step down as president of the country were told to jump to the nearest cliff."This is Zuma's turf if you they don't want him you must step back " chanted the councillors in Sesotho.Another group chanted: "Our Zuma oh our beloved Msholozi you are our leader " they sang in IsiZulu. Msholozi is Zuma's clan name.This was seen as a fight-back from his supporters after calls from civil society opposition parties and even a few members of the ANC's national working committee for him to step down.This follows the president's Cabinet reshuffle a week ago which included the axing of former Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas.The summit was initiated in 2009 to provide a platform for the president to engage with the leadership of all three spheres of government on developmental programmes to help address the challenges facing municipalities and improve service delivery in the country. - TMG Digital
