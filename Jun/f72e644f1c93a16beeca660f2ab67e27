Timo Werner netted twice as Germany set up a Confederations Cup semi-final against Mexico with a 3-1 win over ten-man Cameroon on Sunday. Germany’s midfielder Kerem Demirbay opened the scoring just after the break before Werner’s double sealed victory with Vincent Aboubakar scoring a consolation goal for Cameroon on 78 minutes.
