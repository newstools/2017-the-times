The Highlanders scored the only try of the match and extended the Blues' run of losses in the competitive New Zealand conference to seven.After being beaten by the Waikato Chiefs and Canterbury Crusaders at home in the opening two rounds, the Highlanders beefed up their defence and polished their trade mark kick-and-chase game for the trip north.While the game was no champagned rugby, the improvement in the Highlanders was evident early as the Blues struggled to cope with the high-ball pressure and committed multiple errors which kept them on the defensive for the first 60 minutes.All Blacks centre George Moala mounted a fightback with a 30-metre solo effort that took the Blues deep into Highlanders territory where they pounded the Highlanders line for most of the final quarter.But it was the handling problems which ultimately ruined their finishing burst when a forward drive on the stroke of fulltime ended with the ball lost on the try line.As the Highlanders celebrated, captain Elliot Dixon noted the extra effort that that had gone into their preparation."It was an awesome effort," he said. "We went to the drawing board and thought we needed to step up our game on defence. It was a good improvement for us, but it was a nail-biter."The Highlanders shocked the Blues with their pressure start and were up 10-0 with a Malakai Fekitoa try and a conversion and penalty by Lima Sopoaga before the Blues were able to get on the board with two Ihaia West penalties.The second half was restricted to penalties with the Blues closing to one point at 12-13 before another Highlanders penalty eight minutes from time forced the Aucklanders to go searching for a try."We put ourselves in a position to win it," Blues skipper James Parsons said."But it starts at the start of the game. We needed to set a platform to get the result and unfortunately we took about 20 minutes to do that and we were chasing the game from there on."The Highlanders next week head to Wellington to play the Hurricanes in a repeat of the 2015 final while the Blues play the Canterbury Crusaders in Christchurch.
