Never mind if you're a Buccaneer or Amakhosi fan, the one thing everyone was talking about after the Soweto Derby was the guy who tried to hide after he saw himself on camera. The footage, which is on camera, sees a man in a blue shirt ducking after he realisesÂ  a camera is pointed in his direction. Mzansi went wild after seeing the clip.
