A few days before her official book launch‚ writer and radio host Redi Tlhabi’s twitter account‚ @reditlhabi‚ was hacked on Saturday morning. The hacking comes a week after Tlhabi released her book Khwezi - The Remarkable Story of Fezekile Ntsukela Kuzwayo. Some Twitter users believed the hacking was related to the release of her book. On Monday‚ another account was opened, but it turned out not to be her account.
