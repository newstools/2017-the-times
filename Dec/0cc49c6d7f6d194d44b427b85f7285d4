From designer bags to houses for their parents, and sports cars - some of Mzansi's famous  faces did the most this year.  Here's a recap of some of the gifts celebs gave and received that had us green with envy:  Pearl Modiadie surprised her dad with a house:  This was the sweetest thing any child could do for their parent. #goals Thuli Phongolo added a Gucci bag worth R56K to her already impressive bag collection.  Who needs a blesser when you can bless yourself right? Yaaasss guurl!  AKA spoilt Bonang with a Gucci bag worth R46K to say sorry:  Bonang is no stranger to designer clothes, handbags and shoes. So when AKA put their relationship on blast on social media and told his followers that they had broken up, only for them to work things out a few days later, there was just no way he was getting out the dog box without spoiling his gal.  And, this bag sure is a spoil of note.
