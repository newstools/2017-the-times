Constable Mbuyiselo James Concoshi 34 was killed in his bed in January last year shortly after his wife 40-year-old Nomalanga Paulinah Concoshi found out he was planning to meet a divorce lawyer. Hawks spokesman Captain Philani Nkwalase said according to details that emerged in the high court in Virginia the couple were having marital problems. Nomalanga and her accomplices Papiki Jack Mateise 32 Bassie Ndude 27 and Kopano Samuel Mojanaga 20 overpowered Concoshi and strangled him to death. His body was then driven in his car to the M4 where it was found stripped half-naked between Riebeeckstad and Thabong. Mateise was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder and theft while Ndude was sentenced to 25 years. Mojanaga was handed an effective sentence of 15 years after he pleaded guilty. - TMG Digital/The Times
