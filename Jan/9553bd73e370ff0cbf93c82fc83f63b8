The Urban Warriors were in desperate trouble at the foot of the table in mid-November but the decision to appoint Dutch coach Stanley Menzo to replace Roger de Sa paid dividends.The club won five of their next six matches to lift to ninth in the table but according to Menzo are still far from safe. We are still trying to get out of that area [on the table] we are in still we are not safe Menzo said. We have to improve if we want to stay safe."If we want to go higher up in the league there is still a lot of work to do for me for the whole team for the whole club. The 53-year-old has pushed for some new signings having already captured the versatile defender Rheece Evans on an 18-month loan from Mamelodi Sundowns as well as Zambian international midfielder Roderick Kabwe. The club maybe needs some players who can help us at certain positions so there is still a lot of work to do Menzo said.He added they would only sign players to improve the team and not add numbers. We have to look at what we can find and what we can bring in."It must be extra it must give us a boost and make it [the squad] better. While praising his players for their form in the last six weeks on 2016 he still wants more from them in the coming months. If there is one mentality I try to get out of these players it s don t be satisfied with what you have try to get more out of it."Don t be satisfied with your [league] position . And far from being annoyed that his side s momentum has been broken by the international break Menzo says it was perhaps good for them to get a breather after what has been a tumultuous season so far. I think it is good the team has given a lot physically and mentally coming from last on the log to where they are now.
