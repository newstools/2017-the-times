The association is an influential substructure of the ANC often used to fight factional battles."It deadlocked on essentially what is a very critical council conference resolution that states that conference must take place in accordance with structures of military generals. This would answer some of the questions asked about who are some of these young people that we see at funerals or birthday celebrations."The deadlock is because the present leadership I believe wants to see all these young people dominate in numbers at that conference in order to reserve themselves for their positions " said the committee s General Sphiwe Nyanda.The deep divisions between the MK leaders showed last year when Deputy Minister of Defence and Military Veterans Kebby Maphatsoe and his committee rubbished a special council organised by Nyanda and others at Nasrec Johannesburg to unite former MK soldiers.The Nyanda group in turn boycotted an MKMVA gala dinner in December last year along with several top ANC leaders."Essentially we have reached a deadlock with MKMVA leadership. We have been having meeting for the past month [and] even set up a steering preparatory committee in accordance with our council resolution that the conference of the MKMVA must be prepared " said Nyanda.The date and venue for the MKMVA national conference is still to be announced.
