The feud between Robert and the former Sports Minister is one of the spiciest in South Africa and has occasionally spilt on to social media, where the pair have frequently traded verbal blows.But as speculation continues to whirl around Robert possibly joining Tbo Touch's Touch HD, the hope is that Touch may be able to act as peacemaker between the two.Touch is a close friend of Fikile Mbalula, with the politician having visited Touch on his radio show several times in the past. And, of course, who can forget their all-star weekend together in 2015?Touch is also Robert's friend and if he was to join the station, well, it would be likely that the two would be at a few late night dinners.Meanwhile, fans have responded to Fikile's recent appointment as police minister by jokingly warning Robert to avoid police roadblocks.This person on @5FM now "Mbaks is Police Minister.
