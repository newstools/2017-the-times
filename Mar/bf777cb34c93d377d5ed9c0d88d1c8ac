This includes new infrastructure development that will accommodate growth as well as the maintenance of existing infrastructure."As per the mayor's 10-point plan the current term of office will focus R170 billion on the infrastructure backlog with the help of the private sector that has balance sheets capable of investing about R20 billion a year."So the first emphasis is on eating into the infrastructure backlog which has been quantified at staggering amounts " said City Manager Ndivhoniswani Lukhwareni.He was speaking on Friday at the Hyatt Hotel Rosebank where he was delivering his strategic overview of Johannesburg to investors on the City's 2015/16 performance.Lukhwareni said collaboration with the private sector is much needed in the metro to boost the economic infrastructure.During Gauteng Premier David Makhura's state of the province address in Randfontein last month he spent a large part of his address focusing on infrastructure in the province.Makhura described Gauteng as "the industrial hub of the SADC region" and said that between 2013 and 2016 the province had spent R30 billion on infrastructure development.He said this investment helped create 92 000 jobs and increased government revenue by R6 billion.
