The initiates died from dehydration sepsis and assault. Despite the high number of deaths it is still down on the 2015 summer season when 46 initiates lost their lives. Cooperative governance and traditional affairs spokesman Mamnkeli Ngam said although the figure had decreased government and traditional leaders remained greatly concerned. "One death is too many. The custom does not kill it is the ill-treatment of initiates by those who have criminal tendencies that put a dent in the ancient rite " Ngam said. "Every season we work very hard doing awareness campaigns pumping millions of rands into this only to be disappointed by those who do not care." The Chris Hani district which in 2015 recorded 19 deaths reduced its toll to 12 this summer but it was the worst culprit. The other regions were: Amathole (4); OR Tambo (4); Alfred Nzo (4); Joe Gqabi (3); Buffalo City Metro (1); and Nelson Mandela Bay Metro (1). Ngam said they were praying there would be no further deaths as the season came to an end. Read the full story here.TMG Digital/DispatchLIVE
