The former The Sharks, Bath, London Irish and Newcastle boss, 49, fills the gap left by Dean Ryan's exit last year and will join Worcester on Monday, with an initial brief until the end of the season.Worcester sit just one point above Premiership basement club Bristol, who occupy the division's single relegation slot."The opportunity to return to the Premiership to oversee such an exciting project is something which hugely appeals to me and I am looking forward to getting started," Gold said in a statement."There are nine Premiership games remaining this season and the hard work has already begun as we look to rise to the challenge and ensure the rest of the season is a success."Gold's most recent role was with South African Super Rugby franchise the Sharks and he previously worked as an assistant coach with the Springboks. "Gary is highly regarded in the global game," said Worcester chief executive Jim O'Toole."We believe that working with head coach Carl Hogg and his coaching team, he will take us in the right direction for the rest of this campaign to achieve the obvious goal of improving our league position."Worcester also announced the signing of Scotland prop Ryan Grant from Glasgow, the 31-year-old joining with immediate effect.
