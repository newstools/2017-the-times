The further demise of the once-great Dube Birds was confirmed on Wednesday afternoon after third-from-bottom Garankuwa United pulled off a hard-fought 2-0 win over Dondol Stars in their clash played at Giant Stadium in Garankuwa.United s goals were scored in either half by Gube Molamola and Pakiso Skhosana as they ensured safety from relegation with an unassailable 28 points which means the Swallows and Mofolo BT Stars will be playing amateur football next season.The Birds are sitting second from the bottom with one round of matches to be played this weekend and their last match of the season has been rendered academic as they will only reach only 27 points if they beat Orange Vaal Professionals on Saturday.Earlier on Wednesday Swallows official Godfrey Gxowa said a number of the club s directors are willing to take over the club when it gets relegated.Gxowa who has been associated with the club for almost half a century said together with Charles Makhubu former Swallows midfielder Andries Mpondo and Dan Zwane they are committed to taking over the club and bringing it back to the PSL. There are a number of us who are saddened by what is happening to this club and we are willing to take over and start from scratch Gxowa said. It is sad to see a club with 70 years of history go down because of people who came with the sole reason of making money and with no interests of the club at heart. Swallows were relegated from the Premier Soccer League in May 2015 then from the National First Division last year.- TMG Digital/TMG Sport
