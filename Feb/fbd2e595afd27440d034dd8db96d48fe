Imran Tahir all 37 years of him claimed a career-best 5/24 to help South Africa dismiss the Kiwis for 107 - which was 78 short of the visitors 185/6.But the Kiwis had already slipped to 50/3 when Tahir came on to bowl in the ninth over. Clearly South Africa s win was built on more than his bowling. I ve got a really young bowling unit who are extremely eager to buy into whatever s necessary on the day Faf du Plessis told reporters in Auckland. They re so fresh: they pretty much go with whatever s required. Chris Morris who turns 30 in April can t be called young in terms of age.But Friday s game was only his 12th T20 for South Africa - and he made it count by dismissing Glenn Phillips and Colin Munro with consecutive deliveries in the third over.Andile Phehlukwayo who turns 21 on March 3 held his nerve and with that a haul of 3/19.For all that there no getting away from the fact that Tahir was the star. He is a big reason why we ve had the success we ve had over the last 10 months (in the short formats) Du Plessis said. He s just become so consistent and that s a massive weapon. Even if teams to get off to a good start you know the chances of him coming on and doing really well are very high. He s not bowling bad balls anymore and he puts a lot of pressure on the opposition with his variety and skill. As impressive as Friday s performance was Du Plessis knew it didn t count for much in terms of the five-match one-day series that starts in Hamilton on Sunday. That s the only thing you can really take away from tonight the fact that you want to start a series really well he said. When two good teams are playing against each other you want to put a peg in the ground and show what brand of cricket you are playing. In a one-off game where anything can happen it was about the style of cricket we played. But Sunday is a brand new start and we have to make sure that we start over because they re a quality one-day side. - TMG Digital
