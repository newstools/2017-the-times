 We expect Parliament to schedule this Ad Hoc Committee during the coming week said DA spokesperson on public enterprises Natasha Mazzone.This follows media reports on Sunday of further Gupta capture of the ANC government she said.According to reports on Sunday the Director General (DG) of the Department of Public Enterprises Richard Seleke allegedly leaked important information to the Guptas about deals with state owned entities and emailed his CV to President Jacob Zuma s son Duduzane Zuma half a year before being hired as the DG. Similarly reports today reveal that a former Independent Non-Executive Director of Transnet Iqbal Sharma passed on the agenda of Transnet s board acquisitions and disposals committee - confidential board committee documents - with the Guptas a week before a May 2014 meeting of the board that hiked the costs of a locomotives tender that was expected to earn the Guptas R5.3 billion said Mazzone.She said these reports further exposed the depth of the governance failures of public entities under Minister Lynne Brown and allegations of Gupta capture against her. This only adds to scandals at Eskom Transnet SAA Denel - all benefiting the Guptas and all on Brown's watch. Brown must urgently suspend Seleke pending the Ad Hoc Committee investigation. The DA is also investigating adding to the criminal charges laid on 30 May 2017 based on today's revelations Mazzone said. We believe that captured and pliable public officials and executives of public entities must be urgently dealt with. For now we demand the suspension of Seleke pending Parliament's investigation. The DA is adamant that Parliament must launch an Ad Hoc Committee investigation into the Guptas' capture of Jacob Zuma his Ministers and the ANC government to get to the bottom of growing evidence that our country has been sold off in large chunks Mazzone added.
