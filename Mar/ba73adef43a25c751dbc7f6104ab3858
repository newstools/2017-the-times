This is the view of legal analyst Prof Shadrack Gutto after the the South African Social Security Agency went to court last week to inform the court it was unable to take over the payment of grants.The court on Wednesday demanded answers from Sassa on who at the agency determined Sassa would not be able to pay the grants itself on April 1.The court also wanted to know when Sassa became aware of the problems and why the court was not informed of the fact.The court in 2014 declared that the awarding of a tender by SASSA to pay social grants to Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) was invalid. However the court suspended the order invalidating the contract until a new tender could be awarded or until the current tender runs out on March 31 2017.In the 2014 judgment the court ordered Sassa to update it on progress to award a new tender.The court discharged its responsibility to oversee the work of Sassa in November 2015 after the agency reported it had decided to take over the function itself. The court was wrong in what it did. It should have asked for more details on Sassa s operational plan Gutto said.However University of KwaZulu-Natal law expert Prof Warren Freedman disagreed and said that the view might be a bit harsh.He said without the benefit of hindsight no one knew the country would be in the situation it found itself in. Freedman said nobody would have expected Sassa not to do anything after it promised the court it had everything under control. This was 2015 and there was enough time for a new plan to pay recipients to be put into place Freedman said.He also said the court was also respectful of government. If government promises the court it will do something the court usually shows respect to government that it will fulfil its obligations. Freedman said in the past few years a trend had emerged where the courts want to know who was a particular person responsible for a decision. The courts must have seen that holding government responsible was not working. By identifying individuals the courts believe they can get more accountability from government Freedman said.In its directions the court said it required answers to its questions by no later than 4pm on March 13.However Gutto expressed hope that the court would come with a solution to solve the problem faced by Sassa.- TMG Digital
