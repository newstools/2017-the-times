A rhino horn thrown from their vehicle was recovered, and a third man and suspected accomplice, a Zimbabwean national, was also arrested.The three men are due to appear in the Makhado Magistrates Court on Monday on charges of illegal possession of a rhino horn and the illegal hunting of endangered species. Police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the breakthrough came on Friday afternoon, when members of the Limpopo Endangered Species Unit (LESU), received information the suspects were attempting to sell rhino horn. Members in two of the unit s vehicles began tailing a white Toyota double-cab matching the description they were told would be used to transport the horn. When the suspects realised that they were being followed, they threw a bag from their vehicle and sped off."Some of our officers stopped to retrieve the bag, while the others continued the pursuit. It turned into a serious car chase Mojapelo said.The fleeing suspects were finally arrested by uniformed officers who stopped the vehicle on the Makhado-Vivo road outside Louis Trichardt (Makhado).The bag that was retrieved was found to contain one rhino horn. Investigators suspect the horn might be connected to a poaching incident in the Witpoort area that occurred last week where a rhino cow and her calf were shot and dehorned. Forensic tests to confirm this will be conducted Mojapelo added.Both brothers served time in the Kroonstad prison for killing two rhinos at Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park in KwaZulu Natal in 2006.They were caught red-handed by police and Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife officials, minutes after killing two rhinos.Officials found four rhino horns, three illegal firearms and ammunition, knives and gloves used to remove the rhino horns, two-way radios and various documents.In 2007 they were sentenced in a Free State court to 10 and five years respectively, for poaching and illegally trading in rhino horns. Part of their sentences was suspended.In 2010, one of the brothers, who ultimately served five years of an eight-year sentence, reneged on a previous plea-bargain agreement to testify against a major rhino horn-trafficking syndicate, claiming intimidation and threats made to his life. The syndicate included well-known South African professional hunters and outfitters.Investigations also linked the brothers to a killing spree of at least 19 white rhinos in different provinces between December 2005 and August 2006, including eight rhinos at Kruger National Park, as well as more dead rhinos on private farms in Limpopo, and Mpumalanga.
