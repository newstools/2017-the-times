Johannesburg Water put out an alert late Thursday saying that some reservoir outlet valves would be closed resulting in no water supply at all in places between 8pm and 4am until further notice . The targeted water restrictions are aimed at reducing escalating water consumption despite the recent rainfall which led to a slight increase in dam levels.Were you affected overnight?
