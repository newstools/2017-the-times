The land question hovers over the party's battles as President Jacob Zuma saw his calls for expropriation without compensation snubbed by those drafting policies for debate at the ANC's national policy conference in June.The proposed policy ignores Zuma's more radical calls and suggests "just and equitable compensation" for expropriated land, significantly at odds with Zuma's and the populists' line.Increasingly, Zuma appears to act outside of the ANC's mores - in itself a major contributor to the malaise.This weekend, hours after ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe berated Andile Lungisa for running for - and winning - the Eastern Cape ANC's regional chairmanship, Zuma flew in to Port Elizabeth to congratulate him - an astounding public slap in the face for Mantashe.All of this serves to support the analysis offered by ANC head of policy Jeff Radebe on Sunday. He spoke of a party "losing the trust" of the electorate, subjected to increasing public criticism and desperately in need of renewal.The appraisal is stark and honest and would be accepted as accurate by outside observers.Yet the party appears incapable of reining in the damage while it debates its causes and the remedies.Insulting the intelligence of the electorate would appear to be the new national sport, illustrated by the Sassa grants debacle, the dispatching of controversial former Eskom boss Brian Molefe to parliament and suggestions that former SABC head Hlaudi Motsoeneng go there too.The remedy for the ANC's problems lies within its ranks, yet it appears incapable of accepting what everyone else can clearly see.
