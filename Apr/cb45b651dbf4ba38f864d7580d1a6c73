The MEC said non-striking employees were being attacked.She said "scores have been injured since Wednesday with one admitted in the intensive care".State vehicles were also set alight and faeces thrown at offices she said. Urging the National Education Health and Allied Workers Union to intervene to prevent the violence the MEC did not mince her words in a letter to Nehawu s provincial secretary Tshepo Mokheranyana.Mayathula-Khoza said: The Department wishes to draw your attention to the fact that legal action will be taken by laying charges for criminal offences which will lead to the arrest of staff members. In addition the Department will institute disciplinary action against staff for misconduct.""The department will further explore any other measures within the law to protect the lives of the staff and the vulnerable beneficiaries. It should be noted further that this conduct of the Nehawu strikers does not fall within the ambit of a protected strike she said. Mayathula-Khoza said non-striking staff members were also sprayed with teargas inside buildings and that staff members had been forcefully removed from the workplace and denied access to essential service centres such Chid and Youth Care Centres and Service points. Desperation is creeping in and criminality also comes along it. This is unacceptable. I think the union leadership must urgently intervene to deal with criminal tendencies that are now taking over the strike. The Nehawu strike by social development employees is in demand for more favourable working conditions and an increase in salaries.
