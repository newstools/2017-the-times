During a recent interview with TshisaLIVE, Kelly held nothing back when she spoke about scooping one nod at the recent Metro FM Awards nominations.Kelly walked away with a nomination in the Best Female Award category at the upcoming awards ceremony.The singing sensation has been in the industry for more than a decade and believes that she deserves more."In my honest opinion I deserve more. For me I believe that I deserve more because I believe that this album (My Truth) is the best I've released in 13 years but nevertheless I'm grateful for the nomination," Kelly says.Speaking about her latest album My Truth, which is on its way to reaching gold status, Kelly says that the reception to it has been incredible."People love the album and the excitement around it is different. For the first time the album isn't covered by anything else and is all about the talent. For the first time in a very long time I'm appreciated for what I do best, which is sing," she adds.Kelly says the album reintroduced her into the industry. "I've learned that I don't record albums to get someone else's stamp of approval. For me people having to buy the album, come to the shows and download the album, that on its own is enough. If the album gets nominated or doesn't it doesn't really bother me."The songstress explained that in her 13-year career she has only won one award, but she isn't concerned by that.Why? Because God's stamp of approval and the love for her music is all she needs.
