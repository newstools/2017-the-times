Former SABC chief operating officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng on Sunday asked Prophet Paseka "Mboro" Motsoeneng and his church to pray for him to become the president of the country. "When you pray‚ please pray for me. You should pray that I become the president of the country because in me you are going to see a different South Africa‚" Motsoeneng said. He said he was not "eyeing" the 2019 elections as he wanted a woman to run the country. He was a guest at Mboro's Incredible Happenings church in Katlehong east of Johannesburg on Sunday. Motsoeneng said those who thought he was down and out were wrong. "People are saying it's the end of Hlaudi. Actually‚ it's the beginning of a better journey for Hlaudi. The future is bright for Haludi. This is a test and I am enjoying it. "I grew up in the street. I was starving‚ but I knew I'm different because God is with me." Motsoeneng said he was under attack because he wanted to change the country for the better. "All people who are changing South Africa are under attack. I'm one of them." Motsoeneng was fired by the public broadcaster after being found guilty of misconduct for comments he made at a media briefing in which he criticised SABC board members and a parliamentary committee that was looking into alleged irregularities at the public broadcaster. - TimesLIVE
