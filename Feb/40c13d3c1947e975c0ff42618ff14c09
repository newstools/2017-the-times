"Parliament wishes to reject as misleading the allegations that parliament spent over R11-million in organising and staging the State of the Nation address," said parliament spokesman Moloto Mothapo.Parliament secretary Gengezi Mgidlana had said organising and staging the speech would cost R4-million, as against R4.5-million last year.But DA chief whip John Steenhuisen said additional cost incurred by the heavy police and military presence at parliament this year had increased the bill.He said his investigation had revealed that the police spent R4.085-million and the Department of Public Works R2.7-million more this year than last.He said the State Security Agency had refused to answer his questions.Steenhuisen said the military said it had spent R204,153 on providing 441 personnel for six days "to maintain law and order during the opening of parliament".He suggested the amount was more because last year the military spent R344,405.28 on only 188 personnel for four days.
