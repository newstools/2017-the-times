The body of a baby was found on Thursday in a debris-strewn riverbed in Umlazi’s E-Section near Durban. A passer-by noticed a limb protruding from debris and litter lining the bank of the river in the wake of last week’s mega-storm. The child‚ yet to be identified‚ was found 3km from an informal crèche where toddler Okuhle Kweyama was last seen. The child had been washed away by flash-flooding on Tuesday last week and has been the focus of an intensive search by police rescue divers. This is a developing story.
