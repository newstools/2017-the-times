Winnie Nxumalo, 50, the first of two wives, maintains that polygamy requires true love and compromise.At first when her husband asked her permission to take a second wife she was shocked, felt betrayed, and uncertain of his love for her."Out of love for my husband I welcomed the second wife. It was tradition that when she came into the family she stayed at my home so we may bond."She said they became good friends, the second wife's children became hers, they had grown to respect each other, and did not compete for their husband's attention and love."As the elder wife I arranged her lobola negotiations and wedding ceremony. She stayed with me until after her wedding."Cynthia, 28, a B-Tech management services graduate does not mind being the second wife to her 50-year-old husband."My husband treats me way better than guys my age have ever treated me and supports my dreams. I love him. He is my best friend. He was there for me when I was studying, and mentored me when I started my own business."He has a family, I knew the first wife while we were dating."She said before they married she had attended family gatherings at which the first wife also attended, "but she has not warmed up to the idea of all three of us".Her husband pays her rent and both wives spend an equal amount of individual time with him.Cynthia said when their husband travelled overseas each wife got a turn to travel with him. They also divide up travelling with him on his local tripsAccording to three men, 53-year-old BZ Mbatha, who has three wives; 55-year-old Caiphus Xaba, who has three; and 56-year-old Dalton Dlamini, who has two, polygamy is an important traditional practice, especially for carrying family names forward."A man can marry again if his first wife is barren orhas girlchildren only," says Xaba.Dlamini says there was the situation of his first wife not getting on with her in-laws, and as a result he had to marry again to bring peace to the family."If a man dies before his wife has had children, his brother is compelled to marry the wife and take her as his second wife - he must be a married man with his own wife," Mbatha says.He says sometimes the ancestors will demand that if the husband dies before he has built a home for his wife, a separate home must be built for her to carry his name.And sometimes a man falls in love with another woman and wants her to join the family.Thoko Mkhwanazi-Xaluva, Cultural Rights Commission chairman, says young people embracing polygamy are part of a social revolution that is helping to redefine what is and what isn't harmful traditional practice."Young people, who are educated and economically empowered, are starting to make choices that suit them culturally and otherwise. It is more legally and economically empowering to be in a polygamous marriage than to be a mistress."
