In a time when all of South Africa's fast bowlers are barely hanging onto Kagiso Rabada's coattails Ngidi is content with the short-format duty he could find himself taking part in due to Rabada's rest- enforced absence.Rabada may be 10 months older than the Hilton College old boy but Ngidi is already learning from the Proteas spearhead about adapting at the highest level.For a 21-year-old he seems to be at ease with his game even though Sri Lanka as battle-weary as they are after a difficult test series will be a different kettle of T20 fish starting on Friday at SuperSport Park. I've had a few conversations with KG and those have been very insightful and I already feel I know what's required to play and stay at the highest level " Ngidi said."I know I still have to play but I have a pretty good mindset of how to go about playing at this level. The shortish length that I bowl is a natural one and I know I get a lot of bounce when I bowl."When you run in and hit the deck very hard you make it very uncomfortable for the batsman."Naturally I've been able to do that because that's what has worked for me."I've also been given a path by batsmen in terms of sticking to what works and what doesn't. Ngidi had the fortune of being in the same place as recent test debutant and Knights seamer Duanne Olivier when he received the important call from selection convenor Linda Zondi.It happened to be the best piece of news for the youngster as the Sunfoil Series game between the franchises in the first week of January was washed out and had trouble keeping the secret from his teammate. I was under the covers and about to pass out when the call from Mr Zondi came " Ngidi said."It was around 10pm and I didn't quite believe what I was hearing."When the call ended I looked at my call log a few times to see if it was actually him. Having to keep the secret I sat there with a smile on my face and I had to keep the secret from my roommate who continuously asked what I was smiling about."My parents were the first to hear about the selection and they were very happy. - TMG Digital
