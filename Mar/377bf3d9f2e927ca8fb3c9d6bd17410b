Peers voted to amend the "Brexit Bill" to force the government to guarantee the rights of EU citizens living in the UK. Seven Tory peers backed the amendment.However, May is confident the amendment will be rejected by the Commons later this month and Downing Street insisted the timetable for opening negotiations to leave the EU remains unchanged.Lords who voted to alter the bill were accused by critics of "playing with fire" and "a disservice to the national interest".The scale of the government's defeat in the Lords, where the proposal to amend the bill was passed by 358 votes to 256, prompted speculation May could face a fresh Tory rebellion when the bill returns to the Commons. Conservative whips are confident, however, that only a handful of Tory MPs will support the amendment.The Prime Minister has already told MPs that she wants to protect the rights of the 3million EU citizens living in the UK, but will only issue that guarantee once the EU has granted reciprocal rights to the 900,000 Britons living in member states.Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader who voted to leave the EU, said of the vote: "It is a bit of posturing by some people in the Lords who are beating their chests and puffing out their own sense of self-importance. My answer to that is 'jolly good, nice to hear from you, but it has no bearing on Theresa May's Article 50 negotiations'."It speaks volumes about who some of these people in the Lords think they are and absolutely nothing about Brexit."Labour's amendment to the EU Bill, tabled with Liberal Democrat and crossbench support, calls for ministers to bring forward proposals ensuring the rights of EU citizens living in Britain will continue post-Brexit, within three months of triggering Article 50.
