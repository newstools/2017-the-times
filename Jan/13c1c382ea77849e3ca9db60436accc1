The original decision, announced on Tuesday, raised eyebrows - for good reasons. First, this was the only time since the applicable law was passed in 2003 that the extended trading option was to be used. Second, it had an unabashed link to the ANC's 105th anniversary celebrations on Sunday.The board insisted that its decision was taken independently and without political imperative.Those undertakings, though, rang hollow with opposition parties and other groups which found the coincidence a little too convenient to accept.However, the condemnation by the ANC Women's League yesterday, and the ANC's distancing itself from the move, would add some credence to the liquor board having "gone it alone".But that aside, this storm in a beer mug highlights continuing concerns about South Africa's liquor regulatory environment.It highlights the fractured and inconsistent landscape that exists, and which hospitality body Fedhasa criticised last month.The now-revoked decision by the board, for example, was also contrary in spirit to that of the controversial Draft Liquor Amendment Bill, now open for public comment, which seeks a more regulated and conservative regime, including raising the legal drinking age.Such contradictions add weight to Fedhasa's argument in favour of a single national liquor law, a single provincial liquor law, and a single bylaw applicable to all. We agree.A single regime would provide consistency and could help avoid the controversies unleashed this week by the Gauteng board.In a country reputed to be among world leaders in alcohol consumption, it's a path that is worth sober contemplation.
