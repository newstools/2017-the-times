Bafana caretaker-coach Da Gama named a squad on Thursday at Safa House for the internationals against Guinea-Bissau on March 25 and Angola on March 28 that has already been roundly praised for its adventurism.Mamelodi Sundowns blisteringly in-form Percy Tau and Cape Town City s destructive winger Lebogang Manyama have finally been handed long-overdue call-ups.Amajita internationals Luther Singh and Phakamani Mahlambi have been included.There have been recalls too for discarded Lens forward Kermit Erasmus and FC Twente midfield star Kamohelo Mokotjo who had become estranged from the national team under ex-Bafana coach Shakes Mashaba.Da Gama said since Bafana beat Senegal 2-1 in a World Cup qualifier in Polokwane some players had made it hard not to be included. When you look at the squad we last played against Senegal on November 12 so there s been a bit of a gap SA s caretaker-coach said. We have been following players all over the world."Kermit Erasmus has started playing quite regularly now."Mokotjo has always been playing and he s doing very well for his team. The two youngsters that we have brought in Singh and Mahlambi I think this will encourage them and a lot of youngsters to work harder. And I think it s a step in the right direction to give hope to youngsters and encourage them to do well at their junior national teams. We ve tried to look at the Senegal squad and we didn t want to change too much there."You want to take the Senegal squad and try and strengthen it as best as possible. I think that allowed us to move in this direction. Mahlambi and Singh have turned out for Amajita at the Caf U-20 Africa Cup of Nations where SA lost 1-0 in extra-time against hosts Zambia in Wednesday night's semifinal in Lusaka.Singh is the current tournament top scorer.Da Gama took a refreshing turn towards selection on form not reputation.There were call-ups too for SuperSport United s in-form forward Thabo Mnyamane and Kaizer Chiefs steadily developing centreback Lorenzo Gordinho.Retained from the Senegal squad are goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune and defenders Ramahlwe Mphahlele Rivaldo Coetzee Thulani Hlatshwayo and Tebogo Langerman.Midfielders Hlompo Kekana Keagan Dolly Andile Jali and Dean Furman and forwards Thulani Serero and Lars Veldwijk also keep their places.Midfielder Tiyani Mabunda who replaced Furman when he was ruled out injured and performed well on debut against Senegal has been retained.With the SA Football Association yet to name a new coach Da Gama takes charge of this month's friendlies.He was also caretaker in the 1-1 friendly draw against Mozambique in November four days after the win against Senegal after Mashaba was suspended for a post-match outburst directed at his Safa bosses immediately after the 2018 World Cup game in Polokwane. - TMG Digital/TGM Sport
