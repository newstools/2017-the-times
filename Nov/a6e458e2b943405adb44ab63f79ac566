The WhatsApp messages on the phones of the three central characters in the case against murder accused Jason Rohde tell a story of his fiery love for his mistress Jolene Alterskye and loathing for his wife Susan. Rohde stands accused of killing the mother of his three daughters in their hotel suite in Stellenbosch last year. Details of the chilling exchanges between the couple and Alterskye emerged in the High Court in Cape Town on Monday. Cellphone expert Warrant Officer Anna-Marie van Niekerk testified about the details of certain messages as deemed important to the case by the investigating officer Sergeant Marlon Appolis. Many of the messages were sent within the last 24 hours of Susan's life. In July last year‚ Rohde‚ who was the director of Geffen International Realty Franchises‚ attended a company conference at the Spier wine estate in Stellenbosch.

So tomorrow will be better. Have a good night.” (This message was never read.) On July 24‚ the final messages from Susan’s phone went to Alterskye just after 7 am on the morning Rohde said he found her hanging from a towel hook fixed to the bathroom door. According to Rohde‚ at about 7 am he and Susan woke up and she was still “very cross” with him. He said she went into the bathroom and he fell asleep again. If the police's records are accurate‚ it was about that time that Susan replied to an earlier message sent by Alterskye which read: “Go wash your mouth.” Susan wrote: “Whore-wash your own f***ing mouth…After you such my husband’s dick” (sic)..Jason said you were only good for one thing and that’s why he keeps coming back. He said you would be the last person he ever wanted to be with.” At the same time Jason receive a message from a friend asking if he was OK. He replied: “Drama‚ but okay.” Van Niekerk also testified that Rohde and Alterskye called each other a total of more than 2‚266 times between February and July 2016. Defence advocate Pete Mihalik stated that during the same period Rohde and Susan called each other a total of 1‚703 times. The case continues on Tuesday when Newcombe is expected to testify.
