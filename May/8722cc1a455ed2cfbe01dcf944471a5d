National Consumer Commissioner Ebrahim Mohamed didn't hide his disgust at the conduct of major holiday clubs operating in South Africa when announcing a new public enquiry into the timeshare industry today. It s disgusting in my view that captains of this industry can turn a blind eye to the relentless pain and suffering of consumers for such a long time he told a briefing in Pretoria.The industry now prefers the term vacation ownership to timeshare .Consumers have alleged that: The most disturbing aspect of it all I think is that the vacation ownership industry has done little or nothing to correct itself which is naturally what every industry should be doing when issues are raised with its roleplayers conduct products or services Mohamed said.According to the Vacation Ownership Association of SA (VOASA) it s a R3 5 billion per year industry locally with more than 200 resorts and 500 000 shared owners .In 2015 the National Consumer Commission (NCC) lodged an application with the National Consumer Tribunal following an investigation into major holiday clubs including Univision the holding company of Quality Vacation Club and Club Leisure Group which owns Flexi Club.The cases were withdrawn by the NCC according to Mohamed because of technical defects . We were legally challenged by the clubs and we realised it would prove very costly for taxpayers to proceed VOASA has expressed its utter dismay at Mahomed s claim that the industry has turned a blind eye to consumers suffering. In 2008 VOASA representatives met with the then Unfair Business Practices Committee to propose amendments to the legislation in order to assist consumers said spokesman Alex Bosch.Nothing became of those he said and in 2015 VOASA submitted an amended Code of Conduct for the industry to the National Consumer Commission for review and approval but the NCC has not acknowledged nor commented on this document . We believe that every effort has been made by VOASA and its industry captains to remedy any challenges faced by consumers and the vacation ownership industry Bosch said. VOASA will continue to make itself available to engage with the enquiry panel and help wherever needed. Today's enquiry announcement is the NCC s Take Two industry challenge intended to identify the root causes of the issues experienced by consumers make findings on the facts and evidence presented and make recommendations on how to address the consumer issues highlighted in the complaints .A three member panel - all attorneys with combined experience in consumer protection property law and contract management - will with the NCC s technical task team spend six months gathering evidence by engaging with consumers who have filed complaints as well as industry players regulators academics and courts.At the end of that process the panel is expected to recommend how the gaps inadequacies misalignment and inefficiencies in the laws regulations policies and codes regulating the industry can be addressed in order to better protect consumers.- Wendy Knowler is 'In Your Corner' as TimesLIVE's consumer champion.
