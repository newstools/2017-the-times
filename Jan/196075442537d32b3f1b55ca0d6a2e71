History says the start is traditionally slow as officials come back from their festive season holidays.But there is the potential for a busy month as teams at the top of the table seek to put the finishing touches to their squads and clubs at the bottom try to find the right formula for survival.BidVest Wits and SuperSport United have already said they will be adding numbers to their squads with the coach of the former Gavin Hunt excited at reuniting English striker James Keene with young starlet Phakamani Mahlambi.Both have had lengthy spells on the sidelines but Keene will be re-registered this month as he looks to build on a fine start to his career in South Africa that saw him net eight goals in 12 starts in the second half of last season."He will make a big difference " Hunt told reporters."He will make a big difference because he s different to what we got."So he will make a big difference I know it."He s training well now let s see."He's registered now for the second round of the season."Another player tipped to join Wits though it has not been confirmed yet is former Ajax Cape Town midfielder Granwald Scott who has failed to nail down a regular starting place in Slovakia with Slovan Bratislava.SuperSport United coach Stuart Baxter says he will be looking to add depth to his squad as they chase the championship but says they will unlikely to be household names. You ask any coach approaching any window he will always give you the classic 'we are always on the look-out in the market blah blah blah'. The truth is that our budget does not allow us to do loads of things " Baxter said. We are not a Chiefs Pirates or Sundowns that has loads of money in the kitty almost all the time."But you are also talking to a coach who has had 17 fit players for the last three games. I would love to get in one or two but will they be household names and will we be paying the kind of money that [Brazilian international] Oscar is making in China? No we wont. I don't think I will be making many headlines for you but we must be looking because of situation with injuries " he said.The big question at Mamelodi Sundowns is who could be leaving the club this window with Keagan Dolly seemingly the most likely.Khama Billiat is a target for a few European clubs but will probably only move at the end of the season if at all.But Dolly has recently been the subject of a 500 000 Euros (about R7.2-million) bid from French Ligue 1 side Montpellier according to reports in that country.That is unlikely to tempt Sundowns in parting with one of their star man but could just be an opening gambit from the French.The new rule in the Premier Soccer League this season that allows clubs to de-register foreign players and sign others has already seen Ajax Cape Town release Portuguese junior international Jucie Lupeta and Kenyan midfielder Ali Abondo.It opens the potential for them to replace players this month and they have already filled one of those spots with the Zambian international midfielder Roderick Kabwe.City rivals Cape Town City have also parted ways with two of their foreigners in the last few days after Australian midfielder Matt Sim and Latvian defender Renars Rode left the club by mutual consent. - TMG Digital
