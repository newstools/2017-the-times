Makola a tenant in a holiday home over the festive season is one example say the ANC Youth League (ANCYL) of attempts by officials to seemingly target black beach visitors.Speaking to TMG Digital on Wednesday Makola said he was stopped shortly before Christmas despite him informing security that he and his family were tenants. Makola said while he didn't object to searches in the interest of beach safety security was not consistent because a white family behind him in a queue to get onto the beach was not searched.He said he had stayed at the same holiday home in Salmon Avenue for two years running without any incident."When we first arrived on the 20th of December there was none of this. But all of a sudden before Christmas we were treated like every one who had come to the beach for a day. I have no problem with this when the intention is to prevent crime but it shouldn t be selective because the kids ask are you being arrested Dad? and you have to explain because they see other cars going through " he said.The ANCYL in KwaDukuza has accused the Blythedale Beach Residents and Ratepayers Association of seemingly targeting young black beach visitors.The new measures were implemented after thousands of mainly black visitors went to the beach in December and residents complained about noise and filth.This prompted a number of "safety measures" last weekend including a stop-and-search which the ANCYL said was tantamount to a monopoly on public spaces.Now the group is proposing a name change of the beaches in KwaDukuza to reflect the struggle of young black people. They want Blythedale Beach to be renamed in honour of Bonga Zungu a local youth leader and councillor.Regional secretary Musa Zondi said while his party would not condone public indecency public drinking and litter these issues were faced at other coastal towns including Tinley Manor Zinkwazi Thompson s Bay and Ballito and visitors were not subjected to the same stop-and-searches as at Blythedale Beach."The beaches along the north coast were often used by rich white minorities who indulge in alcohol in an excessive manner and like nobody s business and yet no one says anything to them " said Zondi.Attempts to reach a spokesman for the residents association Emeric Piltz were unsuccessful.KwaDukuza mayor Ricardo Mthembu said his office had received numerous complaints about racist searches at the beach but added that there were elements of racism in the conduct of both the residents and visitors to the area.Mthembu said it was not a private security company that manned the entrance to the beach but municipal security officials and occasionally the police."They are merely there to control access and confiscate alcohol. There is a thinly-veiled issue of race in the issue of Blythedale. It's an issue that was created by apartheid spatial planning in that the beach was designed for a small number of people when it is now catering for all communities of Ilembe " he said."It's difficult for the municipality to balance this when residents feel they have a right to party on New Year's eve and resident feeling their rights rightly so are being infringed upon. The conflict does lead to race squabble " he said.Mthembu said while the municipality would investigate the allegations of racism as a long-term project the town was looking at developing another beach to lessen the problem.KwaZulu-Natal MEC for transport community safety and liaison Mxolisi Kaunda avoided speaking directly about the access control incident. He said however that while there were municipal by-laws in place when it came to residents wanting to control and police their neighbourhoods some incidents bordered on racial.He would not comment on the specific issue but praised communities for working with law enforcement agencies. Credit must also go to the members of the community for heeding our call to co-operate with the police when executing their duties he said.- TMG Digital/The Times
