Haaibo! What is the world coming to when Pearl Thusi is complaining about her tummy? The TV star recently posted a video of herself having treatments done and said it was because her stomach was not respecting her. Ja. This is the stomach. And this one. "I need to be honest: I'm a young mom and America showed my flames in terms of food and my stomach is not respecting me," said Pearl. Mara Pearl. Guuurl, you've left us touched.
