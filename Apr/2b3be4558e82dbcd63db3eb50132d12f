At the centre of the dispute is the refusal of farmer Lawrence Hoatson to recognise the Democratised Transport Logistics and Allied Workers' Union, which claims to represent 250 workers at Normandien Farms, in Newcastle, northern KwaZulu-Natal.Hoatson accuses the union of trying to force its way onto the farm.The union's national general secretary, Vusi Ntshangase, accused Hoatson of "demonstrating a high-level of union-bashing".Things came to a head last week, when four workers were injured after allegedly being shot by security guards hired by Hoatson, prompting the intervention of agriculture MEC Themba Mthembu.Operations have been at a standstill at the farm since workers went on strike on March 6 in protest at poor working conditions and the lack of a minimum wage.In terms of the sectoral determination for farmworkers announced by the Department of Labour last year, farmworkers are entitled to a minimum monthly wage of R3001.13 with effect from March 1.But community leader Lucky Shabalala said workers at Normandien still got only R2000 a month."Their demand is that their union be recognised so that the issue of the minimum wage can be negotiated, but the employer does not want the union," he said.The workers, he said, were also entitled to annual and sick leave, but when they tried to negotiate with Hoatson he hired a security company.Ntshangase said it was worrying that in 2017 workers still had to fight for their constitutional right to belong to a trade union."The strike is about wages but more about their right to belong to a union. The employer has demonstrated a highlevel of union bashing attitude. We intend to continue with the strike and workers are adamant to fight until their constitutional right to belong to a union is recognised," he said.Mthembu's spokesman, Khaye Nkwanyana, said the MEC had invoked the Land Tenure Act to return the workers to their homes."The remaining issue is their livestock that the farmer did not allow back on the basis that they have overgrazed his farm," said Nkwanyana.He said the department was negotiating for the use of a nearby farm for the livestock to graze on.Mthembu is expected to return to the farm soon in another bid to resolve the problem.Hoatson said he would meetgovernment officials who are due to liaise with the workers today."I will be waiting for them to make all the moves," he said.
