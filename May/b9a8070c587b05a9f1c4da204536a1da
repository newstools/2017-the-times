City of Cape Town councillor Grant Twigg confirmed on Thursday that he will contest the position of Cape Metro chairman at an elective conference in July.The region will be highly influential in who becomes the next provincial leader of the DA the following month.The current chairman is Shaun August the City of Cape Town chief whip who is an ally of mayor Patricia De Lille. Earlier this year August was beaten by Bonginkosi Madikizela for the position of interim Western Cape leader after De Lille s surprise resignation.She bowed out amid rumours of divisions over who should be the next Western Cape premier.Late last year Twigg and four other councillors were suspended by the party still under De Lille s leadership for defying its directive during a vote for the sub-council chairperson in Kraaifontein. De Lille is understood to have preferred Clive Justus for the position but Twigg was elected.At the time DA insiders billed the move as a proxy war linked to a breakdown in relations between De Lille and Premier Helen Zille.Said Twigg: Yes I have been approached by quite a few party members in the Cape Metro to consider contesting and yes I will be contesting. Asked if he was wary of challenging for a position held by August Twigg said no party position was reserved for a certain member.He said the disciplinary matter within the DA never materialised.Contacted on Thursday August said he planned to run for another term as Cape Metro chairman but had not decided whether to stand for election as provincial leader.Dylan Mitchell a member of the Western Cape legislature is also rumoured to be considering chasing the Cape Metro DA leadership. I have not yet decided if I will be making myself available for an executive position again he said.TMG Digital/TimesLIVE
