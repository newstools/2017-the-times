As the drone moves overhead, smoke is clearly still billowing from the wax-manufacturing plant which has been alight since about 9.30am on Friday. Flames continue to burn, even as firefighters say that they have the situation under control and are no longer worried about it spreading to other parts of the building or to adjacent properties.About 400 firefighters, working in shifts as long as 15 hours, have been battling the blaze.KwaZulu-Natal environmental affairs department spokesman Siyabonga Maphumulo said that officials were continuing to closely monitor the situation."The smoke has somewhat begun to subside in intensity from its levels when the fire started," he said.
