There are rumours that Coetzee could be shown the door if the Springboks fail to beat the visitoes in the three test series that starts on June 10 at Loftus Versfeld. I signed last year till 2019 and the contract hasn't changed and personally I take it that in every test where you go and represent the Springboks there is a gun against your head to perform and it's there for everyone " Coetzee said."That includes management and the players because we must win tests because that's important and I've signed till 2019."Coetzee presided over the worst ever Springbok calendar year with only four wins from 12 matches.Among the matches the Boks lost were to Ireland at home Italy in Florence and a record defeat to the All Blacks in Durban.Coetzee also said he was happy with SA Rugby new policy on overseas players that only allows players with more than 30 tests to be eligible for national selection. There's no limit on the amount of overseas based players I can pick and I'm happy with the policy that has been put into place."There are players who have done their hard yards and have taken part in 30 tests and they also need to take part in the succession plan for the 2019 Rugby World Cup and be available for that."The big thing about the policy is about retaining a young player or a potential Springbok and make them think twice about going overseas. Coetzee also had two new backroom staff members in Franco Smith and Brendan Venter added last week while Mzwandile Stick and Chean Roux were demoted to the Under-20's.The time it took for SA Rugby to announce the names made it seem there was indecision within the organisation in terms of finalising their names and Coetzee gave the impression that Venter's inclusion was hanging in the balance.Coetzee neatly sidestepped a question in terms of his happiness and whether he had input in terms of hiring of Smith and Venter but confirmed a defence coach has been earmarked for appointment. I know that Franco Smith is signed and sealed but the other name I just see when Italy plays and when Eddie Jones and the other guy talk about him."It's very interesting. There will be a defence coach that'll be appointed."Actually that's done already and I'm sure you guys will know if you're friends with a certain reporter you might know all the answers Coetzee said. - TMG Digital
