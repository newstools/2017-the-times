The film's producer Elias Ribeiro told TshisaLIVE that the deal with French distributor Pyramide Films also helped the movie get publicity in several major publications, and and on billboards in the country.He also revealed that the deal is worth a whopping R2.5 million.As part of the deal, the film has been released at 41 cinemas across France and is expected to pull in an audience of over 50,000 moviegoers.Speaking about the success of the film, lead actor Nakhane Tour said that he was humbled by the reception it had received."It is insane. It is humbling to hear how the film has done so well in France. I thought, when I took the role, that it might be a small independent film that would soon disappear but it is a beautiful piece of work that was done so well. I think audiences have seen and appreciate the quality of the film," Nakhane told TshisaLIVE.The Wound tells the story of Kwanda, a gay factory worker, who travels from the city to the rural area of his family's origin to be circumcised in a traditional rites-of-passage ceremony.Due to the controversial themes which the film highlights, it has received a barrage of homophobic abuse in South Africa. Nakhane said that he was a little nervous about how local audiences would react to the film when it is released locally."Of course I am concerned but I also feel that audiences need to give it a chance and make up their own minds about it after seeing it for themselves. It could fail at the box office but my hope is then that it would become a cult film, because it has that potential," Nakhane added.The film, which will release in South Africa later this year, will be distributed to 19 countries over the next few months, including America, the UK, Germany, Brazil and Australia.Its producers told TshisaLIVE that they would be entering it for consideration in the Best Foreign Language Film category at the 2018 Oscars.
