In one of the highest quality singles matches ever seen in the 29-year history of the event, Federer showed plenty of the class that has won him a record 17 grand slams, but couldn't quite hold off the bold 19-year-old German.He was left to rue his failure to serve out the first set when leading 5-3 as Zverev took a match ultimately decided by three tie-breakers, 7-6 (7/1), 6-7 (4/7), 7-6 (7/4) in two hours and 30 minutes.In the end, two booming first serves from Zverev, the first teenager to make the top 20 since Novak Djokovic in 2006, closed out the match in front of a record Perth tennis crowd of 13785.It was Zverev's second straight win over the Swiss champ, having beaten him in Germany in June.Federer was upbeat despite his defeat by a player he believes will be a star for the next decade."Sasha (Zverev) can serve big and showed what he can do. But I was happy how I hung around and I had some really good moments."As long as I am injury free, I'm feeling good," the Swiss said.
