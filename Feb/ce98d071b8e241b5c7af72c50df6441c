The glitzy awards ceremony, which will take place at the Durban ICC this Saturday has become a a much-anticipated event on the social calendar. While the aim of the awards is to reward musicians for their hard work, the red carpet glam and performances make it a show not to be missed. Every year two hosts are tasked with steering the ship, and this year, its Pearl and Amon. After much speculation SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago confirmed the news. "It is true, every year we change it around and this year it was their turn," Kaizer told TshisaLIVE. Kaizer explained why Pearl and Amon was their first choice this year. "They share a show on Metro FM and we wanted to take the synergy that they have and move it from radio to the event," he added. Last year the swanky event was hosted by Bonang Matheba and Mo Flava. Pearl has expressed excitement over the gig and has been responded to congratulatory messages. . Let me jump up and down with you . https://t.co/tZJnqInybRWe're looking forward to it!!
