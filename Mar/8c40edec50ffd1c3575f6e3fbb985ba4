Strange noises emanating from Spaceship Social Develop ment are clear proof that the party does not have the welfare of us Earthlings at heart.Then, yesterday, State Security Minister David Mahlobo blithely announced that the government was planning to regulate social media to stop the spread of false news.They obviously don't have much to occupy their time on Planet ANC.With our economy at a standstill, corruption ripping at the fabric of society and the scary scenario of 17million people not getting social grants at the end of the month, you'd think our alien masters would be working to put some political basics to rights.Instead, we get someone ordering a social media genie back into its lamp.There is a very good argument for regulation of the internet, which has a very dark side. But it's a problem of considerable enormity and we won't place any bets on it being solved by beings who cannot, over three years, organise the payment of old people's pensions once a month.Social media aren't like the old black and white media, with which it's easy to pinpoint troublemakers. This multi-headed beast grows new heads as quickly as you chop them off.During elections in Uganda last year, the government switched off Twitter and WhatsApp for 72 hours. In a trice, 1.5million social media users - just about Uganda's total number - had re-routed their networks through other countries.And what was everyone angrily Twittering about? The government's clumsy, ineffectual attempt to shut down a free exchange of views.Existing laws covering defamation, libel and racism are applicable to the internet (just ask Penny Sparrow), and should be vigorously applied. But censorship, Mr Mahlobo, is what we used to have on Planet Apartheid.
