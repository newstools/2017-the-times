Africa will vote on March 16 at the Confederation of African Football s (Caf) Congress in Ethiopia to decide five places on the FIFA Council the all-powerful inner cabinet of world footballIn a complicated formula there is one place for a representative from Arabic Portuguese and Spanish-speaking countries; another for Francophone nations and one for Anglophones.The open category will deliver three more representatives one of them female.Candidates for the FIFA council elections had to state when they submitted their nomination which category they wished to contest either their language group or the open contest.Egypt Football Association president Hany Abo Rida who has been a FIFA executive committee member since 2009 entered in the Arabic speaking category originally but sought to change to the open category when he discovered he would be up against Tarek Bouchamoui of Tunisia another who has been on the FIFA Council after winning a landslide election last time out.Abo Rida's request to change was accepted initially by CAF but Jordaan objected because this was against the rules.After taking legal advice CAF has now told Abo Rida he can only run for election in the Arabic-speaking category making Jordaan s hopes of going to Zurich a lot stronger.In the open category the SAFA president who has long held out ambitions of sitting on FIFA s top table is up against Almamy Kabele Camara and Chabur Loc Alei of South Sudan.Camara is a CAF vice president while Goc Alei was last year suspended by his own country s football association on alleged embezzlement charges that he has denied.In the Anglophone category the race is between Kalusha Bwalya (Zambia) Leodegar Tenga of Tanzania and Ghana Football Association boss Kwesi Nyantakyi.After the elections in Addis Ababa CAF intend to change the categories to do away with the open category and have only the three different language groups with two representatives each.Africa has seven places on the new-look FIFA Council but the CAF president is automatically a member and a FIFA vice president and another berth is reserved for a female member.Burundi s Lydia Nsekera is the only women in the African race after SAFA stymied Natasha Tsichlas hopes of also standing in the contest.The FIFA Council is made up of 37 members who each serve a term of four years. They are voted for by their respective continental confederations. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
