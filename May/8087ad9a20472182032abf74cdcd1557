Her counsel Piet du Plessis told the court during her bail application that she has a chronic condition for which she was admitted to hospital last year."I am on a diet and prison food does not cater for my condition " her affidavit reads.Du Plessis asked the court to release his client on bail as she is a first-time offender has a solid background and has no pending cases."There are no facts on which to base the speculation that the amount [defrauded] is R52-million."He said that his client denied any knowledge of an amount of R90 000 that was withdrawn from her account while she was in custody."The investigating officer creates an atmosphere that I am responsible for the withdrawal " Moshabane said in her affidavit.Du Plessis asked the court to make an order to preserve Moshabane's assets until the case is finalised.The state objected arguing that Moshabane had not disclosed her assets and had only done so when the state mentioned them before court."It won't be sufficient for the court to preserve her assets."She did not have the intention to disclose the number of assets she has " prosecutor Bongani Chauke argued.He told the court that the state was still investigating if Moshabane has more assets.Sowetan previously reported that Moshabane has held directorship positions at 14 companies and has since resigned from four.She also owns three properties with a total value of R1.7-million. The properties were however bought before the period she allegedly defrauded MTN.The state has identified two more homes that she registered in other people's names.Moshabane also owns two vehicles a Jeep Grand Cherokee and a Toyota Hilux Raider.Magistrate Jerry van Vuuren later granted Moshabane R200 000 bail.He said the investigation into the case was at an early stage and keeping Moshabane in prison would not be in the interests of justice."The court agrees that the allegations are very serious but there is no link between the applicant and the R52-million."The court found that there was no evidence that Moshabane would conceal or destroy any evidence against her.Moshabane's release on bail is accompanied by strict conditions including that she reports to the Boksburg police station twice a week her passport remains with the investigating officer and that she does not apply for another passport.Moshabane is accused of transferring money from an MTN bank account into her personal bank account between 16 July 2015 and 4 April 2017.She faces charges of fraud theft and money laundering.She has since been suspended by MTN where she worked as a financial accountant.
