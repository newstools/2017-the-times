Pityana in an address called Zuma a limping president who was not trusted by his own party. He said that Save SA had no confidence in the president s ability to reflect reality in his State pof the Nation Address on Thursday. He is a leader not befitting the honour of presidency Nepotism corruption and state capture are the real state of the nation and [he] is at the centre of it. Only when Jacob Zuma goes will South Africa be saved he told hundreds of people gathered at St George's Cathedral in Cape Town for Save SA s Real State of the Nation Address .Cosatu said it had noted the slanderous statements directed at Zuma with amazement . While COSATU believes that all elected officials are fair game to criticism and should be held accountable and in healthy contempt by all the citizens who elected them; we find Mr Sipho Pityana [ s] sanctimonious hypocrisy unbearable the federation said.It charged that Pityana whom it accused of just singing for his supper had been presenting himself in public as this terribly radical courageous and principled leader who is prepared to speak truth to power . The sad reality is that Mr Pityana is part of the establishment and a spineless and subservient apologist for this country s degenerate forces of capitalism Cosatu asserted.
