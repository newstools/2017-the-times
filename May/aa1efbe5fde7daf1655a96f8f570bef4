It is a turn about for the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands club who narrowly saved their top flight status last season but now stand a chance of finishing in the top eight for just a second time. The structures were put in place when we saved relegation on the last day in the last 10 minutes of the league last season after which Ernst Middendorp cleared out and signed crucially experienced guys to be able to help these younger boys to shine. And that is the foundation and structure that was laid and we are just continuing with those structures he said.Davids is expected to be named permanent coach next season after taking over from Middendorp in October and then again from Roger de Sa in March.Last season he also stepped in temporarily to take charge of the team after the respective departures of Mandla Ncikazi and Clive Barker.Davids received praise from Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane for the way Maritzburg have put themselves into top eight contention this season and the man himself praised the performances of many of the younger players in the team. The players have really stepped up and put in the performances and changed their mindset and want to achieve something so my time as coach has given me joy in that regard. These young boys these Diski boys have taken the step up to be PSL players and then held their own against top teams."It s a proud moment for both them and me to take step up from the Multichoice Diski competition. Maritzburg effectively need only to draw their last match of the season at home to Bloemfontein Celtic on May 27 to make sure they will participate in next season s MTN8 competition. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
