Provincial departments receiving the bulk of the budget are:Health: R21.7-billion; Roads and Public Works: R5-billion; Social Development: R2.6-billion; and Human Settlements: R2.6-billion. This means that the provincial government has to continue doing more with less Somyo said. TMG Digital/HeraldLIVE
