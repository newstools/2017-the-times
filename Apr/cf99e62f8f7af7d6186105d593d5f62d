The event, which will be held in Newtown, Johannesburg, has previously been marred by security concerns outside the venue.The event has been criticised in the past for not doing enough to keep concertgoers safe from being pickpocketed or robbed in the areas surrounding the concert. It has also been accused by some fans of not having adequate crowd control for those waiting to enter the venue.It's organisers have increased security at the event and have repeatedly reassured fans that if they are vigilant they would be safe.Rapper Kwesta has also added his voice to these calls."Security is something that we have to deal with in South Africa. It is a way of life and sometimes things happen that are out of our control. I honestly think there is enough security at the event and I am confident that fans will be safe when watching artists perform at the festival," Kwesta told TshisaLIVE.The Ngud' hitmaker also promised his fans "one hell of a show"."I am excited at another chance to perform at Back To The City. It is one of my favourite events to perform at and I can't wait to showcase my music there again. It is always a party," he added.The Back To The City music festival takes place on Thursday April 27 in Newtown, Johannesburg. Tickets are available from Backtothecityfestival.com.
