This was revealed in Parliament on Wednesday by senior officials from the National Treasury's Chief Procurement Office during their meeting with the Standing Committee on Public Accounts (SCOPA).The meeting was convened by SCOPA to discuss a PricewaterhouseCooper report into the coal supply contract which was signed under controversial circumstances in 2015.Some ANC backbencher MPs initially prevented the discussion from going ahead citing the fact that Eskom was not present and claimed that the report had already been finalised.But SCOPA chairman Themba Godi would have none of that and the meeting proceeded with no further interruptions.The PricewaterhouseCooper report into the Eskom/Tegeta deal states that the contract had been poorly formatted contained irrelevant information and ambiguities and that it appeared to have been "hastily" drafted by "copying and pasting sections from other contracts".The auditing firm further found that quality criteria set out for coal specification in the contract had been amended later in a letter to Tegeta which made it unenforceable as both parties "should agree to any amendment in writing and no evidence to this effect was supplied.Treasury official Solly Tshitangano told the committee that the contract initially valued at R3.7 billion for ten years had been signed without a competitive bidding process as it had been concluded under Eskom guidelines that allow for coal to be procured without a tender process if there is a coal shortage.He said Eskom had approached Treasury again in 2016 to extend the contract to include an additional 10 million tonnes of coal but Treasury "could not support that" because issues around the quality of the coal being supplied had not yet been resolved.Tshitangano also detailed information that they believed SCOPA should probe further including whether Eskom senior management had ever considered the report and what steps they had taken. However ANC MP Nyami Booi objected to this saying this was "unparliamentary" and "you can't tell us what to do".Godi said he believed Eskom should be called to present their case."I believe there are a number of issues Eskom needs to clarify " he said.- TMG Digital/TimdesLIVE
