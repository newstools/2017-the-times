The Economic Freedom Fighters leader tweeted on Wednesday that he had warned South Africa about Mantashe: I warned you South Africa that #Gwede will say something completely different after #ANCNWC, exceptionally dubious old man.A clip was shared to twitter that shows Malema predicting Mantashe's change of heart after the National Working Committee (NWC) meeting.Last week, hours after Zuma stunned South Africa with a late-night cabinet reshuffle, Mantashe joined Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa and treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize in publicly criticising the changes. The three revealed that Zuma did not consult them before making the changes, but merely informed them by tabling a list of new ministers."I can't use the word consulted on the matter. That's how I describe it because we were given a list that was complete. And in my own view as the secretary-general I felt that this list has been developed elsewhere and given to us to legitimise it," Mantashe told 702.However, at the briefing of the outcomes of the NWC meeting on Wednesday, Mantashe was singing a different tune as the ANC top five rejected calls for Zuma to resign."The ANC has full confidence in the newly appointed minister of Finance comrade Malusi Gigaba and the deputy minister Sfiso Buthelezi. We will offer them our unequivocal support in executing the budget that was tabled by comrade Pravin Gordhan following approval by Cabinet and through going consultations " said ANC Secretary General Gwede Mantashe.
