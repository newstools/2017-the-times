"We think the one truck had stalled and the other tried to go around in the oncoming traffic lane but also stalled. They were struggling to get going again on the steep gradient which is what caused the complete blockage."He said they were the third car in the row on the descent right behind the youngsters car but he reversed to be more visible to cars or trucks approaching from behind."There was light rain falling and the roads were very wet from steady rain earlier."Badenhorst said he was not sure who the youngsters were or where they were headed.The trucks eventually gained momentum and drove off as did the dancers.
