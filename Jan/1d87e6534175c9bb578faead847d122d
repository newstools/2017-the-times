An employee of a popular restaurant in Soweto's Vilakazi Street was busy packing chairs when she heard two loud sounds going off.Initially thinking it was fireworks she came to realise this was the moment that shots were fired at the 60-year-old general manager of Sakhumzi Restaurant. He was killed during the attempted robbery in the early hours of Sunday morning."We were also preparing to close the store and I had my back towards the restaurant (Sakhumzi) when I heard two gun shots going off " she said."One of the employees from Sakhumzi Restaurant ran into our restaurant and we then decided to shut our doors."I wasn't aware that they had shot baba (name withheld) because there was loud music playing a few meters away..."I honestly thought it was the young boys in the area who were just messing around with crackers " added the eyewitness who asked not to be named for fear of victimisation.The manager was shot twice according to Sakhumzi's marketing manager Archie Tsoka.The eyewitness said two men fled on foot after the shooting.Senior Gauteng police officials and Sakhumzi owner Sakhumzi Maqubela were locked in a meeting for about two to three hours on Monday."Our investigation is at an advanced stage and we are following all the leads which we believe will bear us fruits and lead to the arrests of the perpetrators. At the moment no suspect has been arrested but we believe that all the information that we are getting will assist us in our investigation " Gauteng spokesperson Kay Makhubela told TMG Digital after the meeting.
