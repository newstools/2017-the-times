Joseph Rammusa, 53, is proud to have been the club's president - but he was its last, because in 2013 the once-prosperous town suffered a dramatic reversal of fortune."I was called to come into the office and was given a letter that needed to be printed urgently," said Rammusa, then a clerk working for the town's mine."I started looking at the letter and was taken aback - the mine was being placed under provisional liquidation."For more than 60 years Blyvooruitzicht sat on one of South Africa's richest gold deposits.But a diminishing return on investment prompted the owner to shut down the mine, throwing all 1700 workers out of a job and leaving the site to looters and decay."Things started to fall apart," said Rammusa. The newly unemployed staff did not receive any redundancy pay because of a dispute between two mine operators - DRD Gold and Village Main Reef.The town of 6000 people was threatened with the disconnection of its water and electricity supplies, which had both previously been paid for by the mining company.Also left behind was an open mine dump from which the slightest breath of wind sends a cloud of toxic dust over the town.Armed gangs battle one another to control the old mine shafts.Four years on from the mine's closure, the situation in the town has deteriorated dramatically."We're struggling to get something to eat, to get water from the municipality. Same with electricity [and] we're battling to get our children to school," said Elliot Matshoba, 51, a former safety officer at the mine.Taps run intermittently and sewage flows in the streets.Michael Clements, of Lawyers for Human Rights, said "communities are simply left in a vacuum".In 2015 and 2016 more than 40,000 people in the mining sector lost their jobs - one-tenth of the industry's total head count. In Kroondal, near Pretoria, about 4,000 workers at a platinum mine were fired after a strike. Because they had not agreed to a deal signed by their union, they received no compensation.For seven years a hard core of about 200 holdouts has occupied a building on the Kroondal mine in the hope of securing a payout. They live in abject squalor and TB is rife in the men's dormitories."It is a huge challenge because when it comes to food, everyone here is living on his own. We live on jackals, monkeys, cats - unless we get someone to assist us with food," said the men's representative, Elpideo Mutemba.The mine owner, Sibanye Gold, has applied for an eviction order against what it calls "the squatters" - but until a court ruling is made it has continued to supply the site with electricity and water as a goodwill gesture.The head of DRD Gold, Niel Pretorius, said "it can't be expected of corporations to fix what they didn't break", blaming the situation in Blyvoor on the trade unions, which he accused of "irresponsible behaviour".Three mine companies linked to Blyvoor are now the subject of a lawsuit over their environmental records.For the first time the state is participating in the action against them. Mariette Liefferink, an executive director of the Federation for a Sustainable Environment, said the case could end with mine directors being held criminally liable.
