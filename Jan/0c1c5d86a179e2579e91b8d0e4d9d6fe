That left Woods, 41, looking for new clubs to launch his comeback."After several months of testing and all brands to choose from, the choice is clearly @TaylorMadeGolf. Proud to join the family!" Woods tweeted.Woods will play the company's metal woods, irons and wedges but the deal does not cover the putter.

"Over the past few months, I've had clubs from every brand sent to me to test. When it came to making a final decision, the choice was easy -- it all came down to performance, which is why I chose TaylorMade."In December, Woods signed an endorsement deal to play Bridgestone golf balls. Woods is expected to retain Nike branding on his cap since that firm continues to make golf footwear and clothing.Woods has not played a tournament on US soil since he shared 10th in the Wyndham Championship in August 2015.Woods has eight triumphs at Torrey Pines, including the 2008 US Open, his most recent major victory.He will play the first two rounds there this week alongside two other TaylorMade equipment users -- world number one Jason Day of Australia and fellow American Dustin Johnson, the third-ranked reigning US Open champion.
