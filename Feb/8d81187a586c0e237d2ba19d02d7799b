If anything, it would appear that the period following the publication of the embarrassing report has seen the abandoning of any pretence of distance.A case in point was Friday's speech by President Jacob Zuma at - where else? - a breakfast briefing of the Gupta family's The New Age newspaper.After a night of headbanging chaos in the National Assembly the president chose not to ameliorate the drama of hours before, but to unleash a broadside at the country's major banks, which he accused of being symptomatic of a "skewed kind of economic control" in South Africa, according to a Bloomberg report.Zuma's statements only seem to add fuel to the fire - if more were needed - of speculation about his entwined interests with those of the Guptas. They come as his finance minister, Pravin Gordhan, is asking the courts for a declaratory order preventing him from meddling in the banks' affairs with their clients after the major banks cut facilities to the Gupta empire.Zuma's comments would appear to pander to an opposite agenda and are in line with his remarks in parliament following the release of Madonsela's report at the end of last year.Then he suggested that there may have been some collusion between the banks in how they handled the Gupta banking issue."If a number of banks act in the same way simultaneously, that is not an ordinary act. It suggested there is something untoward here and as government we wanted to constructively interact with the banks to find out what it is that they are doing," he said.With "constructive" engagement producing naught, it appears we are changing gear into an approach that is potentially more destructive.
