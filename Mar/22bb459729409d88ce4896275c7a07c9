The two teams goes into the qualifier with confidence after they won their last matches where the Knights beat the Dolphins by one wicket in their thrilling encounter in Durban while the Warriors beat the Lions by 36 runs on the (D/L) method in Port Elizabeth both on Thursday.Knights coach Nicky Boje will be looking for an improved performance from his charges as they made things difficult for themselves in their last match against the Dolphins. It was quite stressful against the Dolphins at one stage but we managed to pull it off in the end reflected Boje. There were some guys that played really well in that game and it showed that you don t have to always rely on the same guys. Knights will enjoy home ground advantage but Boje said it will count for little against a determined and talented Warriors side. They are a really good side with some real quality players but I feel it will all boil down to how both sides play on the day. Visiting coach Malibongwe Maketa was thrilled with the reaction of his players against the Lions on Thursday night. It was a great reaction and will give us a huge amount of confidence going into this next stage. We have been lucky enough to have played in a few big games like this one in the past few seasons so we will draw on that experience to help us get through he said.Assessing the Knights whom the Warriors beat in both league meetings this term Maketa felt they would present a huge challenge for his side. Play-off games are about who pitches up on the day and both sides will have an equal chance at the start Maketa added. They will be confident because of the amount of close games they ve had so it will be tight. Both sides have retained faith in the same squads that served them well in the last game and have not reported any fresh injuries.- TMG Digital
