Maboke Matlakala scored the 56th-minute winner for desperate last-placed Baroka at Mbombela Stadium on Saturday afternoon. SuperSport had a chance of beating a Premier Soccer League record their coach Stuart Baxter steered Chiefs to in 2014-15 also sealing the title that season.Saturday s performance by Matsantsantsa displayed why their same length of unbeaten run seems unlikely to yield the championship.Chiefs under Baxter were a winning machine capable of grinding out three points more often than they were not. SuperSport have at times stumbled unconvincingly to their unbeaten results and the nine draws among them are testimony to that.Baroka deserve credit for how they took the game to SuperSport who in turn were sloppy with their chances. SuperSport dominated possession in the first half though found chances hard to come by.Kingston Nkhatha got on the end of Thabo Mnyamane s long-ball from deep inside the SuperSport half early in the second half but Oscarine Masuluke spread himself well.A miscued clearance by Morgan Gould saw Onismor Bhasera under pressure with a header which was poorly directed and allowed Matlakala to run through and beat Pieterse with a chip.- TMG Digital/TMG Sport
