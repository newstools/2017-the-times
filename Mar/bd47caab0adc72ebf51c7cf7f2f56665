I got a call from the chairman (Mphahlele) and I liked the challenge that he was throwing at me because I was unhappy at Mbomebela United " he said."It is a good challenge for me to come to Baroka and help in the battle to avoid relegation. It is definitely my biggest test yet and I am ready for it. Dlamini is a highly qualified coach with a Safa Level 3 and Caf A licenses and he maintains he will be up to the challenge. I could not have agreed to come here if I did not believe that I had it in me to help this team achieve the mission of avoiding relegation."I had fun with the players at training where they welcomed me very well but there are good and not so good players in terms of attitude and we will work on that. Asked how he is going to solve Baroka s problems and achieve the daunting mission of avoiding relegation Dlamini who started working with the players on Tuesday said his first task is to work on finishing. If you look at the performance of the team they have scored only one goal in four matches this year and this has been the biggest problem."We will try new combinations because in all honesty the position we are on at the moment is not good but we will move out of the relegation zone."We are sitting at position 16th on the log and the only way is up because we can t go to 17th.
