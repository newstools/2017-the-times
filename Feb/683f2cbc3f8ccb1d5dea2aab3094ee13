He s shown a lot of promise and I think he s got a big future ahead of him. We re going to give opportunities I want to bring a lot of young blood into the squad and this is the start of it Igesund said. He s from our development. We want to bring players through our development. We ve got a great system and we don t want to put it to waste. Brookstone though contradicted his coach s view. No he doesn t really come from our development. He actually comes I think from Black Aces development Highlands chairman said. We signed him for our MDC team in November. To be very frank with you I don t know very much about the player. All that I know is that [Moroka Swallows legend] Les Grobler rates him very highly because Les was his coach. So he s really the right person to speak to. The other person to ask about his background is Mario [Morfou chairman of Alex Black Aces].
