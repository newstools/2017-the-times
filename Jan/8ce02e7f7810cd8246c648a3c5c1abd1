Ajax have already brought in Zambian international midfielder Rodrick Kabwe from Zanaco and could add his teammate Funga to boost a frontline that recently lost Jucie Lupeta after the latter was released. He s done well it s looking good club CEO Ari Efstathiou told Times Media Digital. If he comes in we may look at one more [addition] in this transfer window."There are one or two other possibilities that we are looking at. Funga was a prolific scorer for Zanaco last season in helping them to the Zambian Super League title and can also play behind the strikers as a creative midfielder. - TMG Digital
