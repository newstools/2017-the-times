"It's true that we -- not just the players but all of us -- are not happy with the bonuses that have been given to us because there is a lack of respect," Belgian Broos, 64, told reporters in Franceville, southeastern Gabon, where Thursday's match will be played."When you make these performances, I think the players like something more. I don't think they are asking for the end of the world but what they give us now is not good."Just before the tournament began the Cameroonian federation (FECAFOOT) released a statement saying agreement had been reached regarding bonuses.The squad and staff would receive $25,500 each for taking part plus 12 million for getting to the quarter-finals.However, the agreement stated they would get just three million more for reaching the semi-finals, which they did against all expectations by beating Senegal on penalties in the last eight at the weekend.That statement hailed "the good atmosphere and the quality of the collaboration of the players and the staff", but attitudes have since changed.Nevertheless, Broos insisted the issue would not have any bearing on his team's performance against the Black Stars."Even if we are not happy with the money, we still make performances on the field and I think this is something very important that shows the players are not here for money but to perform for their country, for themselves," he added."We don't come here for money but the other side is that when they give you money you have to feel respect and this is not the case now."Rows over bonuses have been a regular theme at the Cup of Nations.Zimbabwe initially refused to board a flight to Gabon due to a dispute over allowances and bonuses, while DR Congo went on strike from training just before their first game due to unpaid bonuses.
