The state-owned entity warned yesterday that if Durban and its surrounding areas didn't receive enough rain by the end of March, residents are likely to face a 25% restriction on water supply.The water level at Albert Falls Dam is at 26%, and Midmar Dam stands at 56%.Umgeni Water spokesman Shami Harichunder said 15% mandatory water restrictions are already in place."The experts are saying that it is only likely to rain between January and March," Harichunder said."If it doesn't rain, we are going to be sitting with a major problem on our hands."What it means is that water currently available in Midmar and Albert Falls [dams] will have to last until the next rainfall, whenever the next rainfall occurs."He said only the reduction of water consumption could make the dwindling supply last. "It is likely if it doesn't rain by the end of March going into April, water restrictions of 15% could rise to between 20% or even 25%."We can't have that situation, because if dams run dry, the consequences will be quite severe for households, industry and the economy."We can't have an economy without water."Umgeni Water postponed a 16-hour shutdown of the Midmar Treatment Works it had planned for today to Thursday.Harichunder said: "Municipalities have asked Umgeni Water to postpone the shutdown because of the extreme heat. We moved the shutdown to January 26."But Umgeni Water has increased the amount it gives to these municipalities to make sure they do not run out of water during the shutdown."In a bid to cut water consumption, the City of Durban has adopted a hardline policy to illegal car washes, water wastage and illicit connections.In a statement released on Friday, eThekwini warned its residents to stop filling their swimming pools, using sprinklers and washing cars with hoses "during this dire drought situation".Municipal spokesman Tozi Mthethwa said: "Penalties will be imposed on those who don't adhere to the restriction rules."The municipality said : "Depending on where the consumers are in relation to their reservoir zone, whenever there are interruptions in the system, those residing next to the reservoir will be the first to run out of water and those in the low-level zone will be the last."
