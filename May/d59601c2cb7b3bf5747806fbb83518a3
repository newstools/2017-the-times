The four doctors analysed 310 patients admitted to Grey s and Edendale hospitals in Pietermaritzburg KwaZulu-Natal between June 2010 and December 2012.Their objective was to study a long-standing method of evaluating acute kidney injury a common consequence of sjambok beatings. The sjambok a type of traditional stiff whip normally made out of animal leather or plastic is often used to inflict punishment in community justice events said lead researcher David Skinner. Damage to underlying muscle results in the release of myoglobin he said adding that myoglobin deposits and other factors led to kidney damage.Skinner from the medical school at the University of KwaZulu-Natal wrote in the South African Medical Journal that six of the victims in the study who were mostly young men died of their injuries. These findings contrast with other forms of trauma-associated acute kidney injury where authors have reported mortality rates ranging from 28% to 100% he said.TMG Digital/TimesLIVE
