"It's a criminal offence to buy a driver's licence (like a) ngathi ligwinya," Mbalula tweeted back, using another word for a vetkoek. "It will get you, the traffic department and the driving school arrested."' Mbalula, nicknamed "Razzmatazz" from his time as sports and recreation minister, has more than 750,000 Twitter followers and sees his personal feed as a useful tool in the fight against South Africa's high crime rates.
