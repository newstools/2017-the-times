When Lady Zamar took to the stage to perform a medley, opening the DStv Mzansi Viewers' Choice Awards, the last thing anyone expected was Zodwa Wabantu. But there she was, getting down. Fully clothed. Her moves drove the crowd wild and fans watching at home immediately hit Twitter. Love her or hate her. With panties or without. Zodwa is here to stay. (If you don't know who Zodwa is, well, big sigh. She's an entertainer from Durbs who has gained notoriety for not wearing underwear)
