Moukandjo, the Indomitable Lions captain, curled in a superb effort from a dead ball 10 minutes before the interval in the Group A game at the Stade de l'Amitie in Libreville.However, 2013 runners-up Burkina Faso recovered to equalise with quarter of an hour left, Issoufou Dayo bundling the ball in after Banou Diawara's free-kick was saved.The result means there is nothing between any of the sides in Group A after hosts Gabon were held to a 1-1 draw by Guinea-Bissau in the tournament's opening match earlier in the day.
