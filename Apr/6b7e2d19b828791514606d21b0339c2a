When Aaron Motsoaledi survived President Jacob Zuma's night of the long knives on Thursday, many people breathed a sigh of relief: at least one competent minister had been left alone.The revelations to MPs by his director-general, Precious Matsoso, might make that breath catch in our throats. Hospitals nationwide have almost 46,000 vacant posts, which is 11.5% of the total. And there's no money to fill them. One doctor who spoke to The Times said the effect of the shortfall at the sharp end of healthcare was "completely and utterly exhausting".Many of those lucky enough to have medical aid have been grumbling under the burden of hefty premium increases since the beginning of the year.The news Matsoso shared with parliament puts their plight in perspective. They can still secure almost instant, usually excellent care, albeit at a price. They will rarely encounter anything called a "waiting list" or a seven-hour queue to see one of those medical professionals who is way beyond the end of his or her tether.So what's to be done? One MP who listened to Matsoso's presentation said it painted a picture of inefficiency and poor management. And the auditor-general's office pointed out that, with so many vacancies in financial departments, instances of irregular expenditure were becoming more common, exacerbating the bigger problem.It's sad, but true, that this story is all too familiar in the government departments whose services touch the poorest in society. The recent horrifying example of the Department of Social Development springs to mind, with education (basic and higher) not far behind. Surely we can do better?
