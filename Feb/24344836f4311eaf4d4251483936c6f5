The party said its federal council had resolved at a meeting at the weekend to require DA mayors to fully brief the public and the media on the details of what the party had found in those administrations especially in relation to the financial situation and the state of service delivery. Many of these metros and councils have inherited truly parlous finances including cash flow shortages and liquidity concerns very poor debtor management misuse of funds intended for new capital expenditure for operational expenditure and evidence of widespread misappropriation and corruption. This has also left basic service delivery capacities hobbled by funding shortages DA leader Mmusi Maimane said. While our Mayors and their Mayoral Committees and the many dedicated civil servants have done good work thus far to turn this situation around there is an enormous amount of work yet to do. Federal Council felt that it was important to spend more time providing the media and public with more detailed information of what we have found and what is being done to turn it around he added.
