The 33-year-old who hails from Hammanskraal just outside Pretoria will this year choreograph the Namibia Music Awards (NAMAS) for the second time before jetting off to Europe These are really exciting [awards]; it s a two day affair with the first day being the industry awards and the second day being the main awards for the artists said Modjadji who is already in Namibia and hard at work.The awards which take place this Friday and Saturday will be hosted by media darling and Queen B Bonang Matheba and will see gospel legend Rebecca Malope performing there alongside Namibian artists Gazza and Lady May. When I choreographed the awards in 2014 I was the only South African on that stage and this year there are more of us which is a testament to how much the artscape especially in Namibia has grown. He says however that the Namibian artscape is still developing especially in comparison to South Africa. In Namibia the artscape is still very much in its budding stages and working hard on development which leaves room for creativity which is very exciting. In SA we already have an industry that s established and organised so now we re trying to find our South Africanness that we can take global - the same way that the Nigerians have. He has also recently returned from a 10 country dance tour which saw him also scouting for talent. While on the tour we were talent scouting and now as a result we ll be taking ten dancers one from each country - on tour to Europe next month as we head for the Dance Star Championships. Modjadji is a judge on the global competition s panel for a second year in a row. It s quite exciting times right now and I m working on a few other things that I can t reveal just yet but it s clear that 2017 is really going to be an amazing year he said.
