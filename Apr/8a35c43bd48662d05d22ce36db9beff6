"Should that happen the authorities are more than prepared to deal with Mr Ntlemeza," said Mbalula's spokesman, Vuyo Mhaga.In an interview with City Press, Ntlemeza threatened to be back at his desk today, asserting that he did not answer to Mbalula, but rather to parliament.But, said Mhaga, the only time the minister expects to see Ntlemeza is when he comes to hand over all his state equipment."The minister instructed him to surrender all his state equipment, which includes cellphones, laptops and any other equipment that he had use of in his position as the head of the Hawks. "If that includes a car then he will have to hand that over as well."These things that Ntlemeza has been saying - that he will return to work - are not being taken seriously by the minister."Mbalula, speaking during a visit to the Soshanguve police station on Sunday, urged Ntlemeza to vacate his office as the court had ordered him to do."He must vacate in peace. This is not The Bold and the Beautiful."Mhaga said Mbalula was simply following the court's instructions."There is nothing more the minister wishes to say about this, other than that a new acting head has been appointed and that there is work to be done."Last week the Pretoria High Court ordered that an earlier order for Ntlemeza's appointment to be reviewed, be enforced.
