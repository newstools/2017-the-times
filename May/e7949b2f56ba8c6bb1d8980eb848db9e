The Automobile Association s (AA) survey found that about 90% of motorists believe compliance with the laws of the road has worsened over the past two years - and 75% believe the attitude of motorists towards one another deteriorated.About 1 000 people participated in the survey held in April.Across the country results show that 88% of motorists believe adherence to the rules of the road has worsened since 2015. In Mpumalanga 83% of drivers believe non-adherence is getting worse while in the Northern Cape and North West provinces 100% of drivers feel that way. These results are actually quite breath-taking as they seem to indicate once again that most motorists believe the problems on South African roads are someone else s fault the AA said. Given our country s high Easter road fatality rate this attitude implies not enough motorists are taking responsibility for their actions which is worrying. In terms of visible policing on the roads just over 55% of motorists in the country believe it has also declined 13% think it has improved. Opinions on road conditions were also investigated and roughly 61% of motorists nationally said they have deteriorated with common problems being potholes missing or damaged road signs and faulty traffic lights.The biggest provincial offender seems to be Gauteng with 67% of people saying that road conditions are worsening. This survey again highlights that too many drivers believe road traffic laws don t apply to them which when combined with what is perceived to be lower police visibility is perhaps part of the reason for our country s high road fatality statistics said the AA. Unless driver attitudes improve in addition to more effective policing the carnage on South African roads will continue unabated.
