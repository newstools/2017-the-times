 According to Dr Michelle van Zyl from Stellenbosch Mediclinic the youngster was casual and when he arrived at the clinic hours after the murders.However this behaviour is contrary to how his uncle Andr du Toit described Henri's behaviour after his father Martin mother Teresa and brother Rudi were found dead. His sister Marli sustained serious injuries and had been admitted to hospital.Du Toit Teresa's brother said Van Breda was emotional and broke down.On Tuesday he testified in the 'trial within a trial' where Henri's defence team is trying to stop a statement he had given police from being admitted to court.Du Toit said he saw Henri for the first time after the incident at James Reade-Jahn's house in Somerset West. Reade-Jahn had been dating Marli. Van Breda's then girlfriend Bianca van der Westhuizen was also at the house.He described the meeting as "very emotional"."We didn't talk a lot. When Henri speaks he stutters and he speaks very slowly. We just hugged and cried " he said.Du Toit said he left Henri with Reade-Jahn's family because he needed to take the family dog Sasha to his home in Bellville and Henri wanted to be close to the Welgemoed Hospital where his sister was in a critical condition.Du Toit was the first family member at the scene of the crime on the De Zalze estate in Stellenbosch. Du Toit is one of eight children. He was so emotional he could barely speak as he recalled the first time he heard of his younger sister's death.He told the court on Tuesday that Colonel Deon Beneke had asked him about his sister's family."I said I don't know of any problems. Then he turned around and went on with his task " said Du Toit.A colonel then introduced herself and informed him what had happened."Then I realised Theresa and Martin and Rudi had passed away " he said with tears rolling down his cheeks.Last week Van Zyl told the court that upon examining Van Breda she could smell alcohol. The defence argued that this is because he had a beer with family friends.The case continues.TMG Digital/TimesLIVE
