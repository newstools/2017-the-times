"We all know that the Dutch gangsters arrived here and took our land by force," Malema said, "the struggle has since been about the return of the land into the hands of its rightful owners."Malema went on to say that during the negotiations that brought an end to Apartheid, those who represented the black majority sold out "this fundamental principle".Malema said that those who claim themselves to be for radical change, should vote in favour of the EFF's motion to amend the constitution to allow for the land to be expropriated without compensation."It can't be correct that less than 10% of the population owns more than 75% of the land."In 2014 Africa Check checked a similar claim by Black Land First. Andile Mngxitama claimed that "35,000 white families, including white businesses, own more than 80% of the land".Their check found that there was no basis for this figure."Although a state land audit has shown that 79% of South Africa is privately owned, this includes land owned by individuals, companies and trusts, and includes all urban real estate and agricultural and mining land in South Africa. This would include land owned by both black and white South Africans," the fact checking organisation said. The EFF motion was ultimately defeated.The zANC's #LandDabate has exposed the fact that their 'radical economic transformation' is HOT AIR, like their 'war against corruption'!
