In the agency s view the cabinet reshuffle is likely to result in a change in the direction of economic policy to undermine progress in state-owned companies governance raising the risk that the contingent liabilities associated with these entities are realised and increase the prospect of a substantial increased issuance of guarantees in respect of a nuclear build programme."The government would like to reaffirm its full commitment to the policy stance contained in the President State of the Nation Address and the Budget 2017."Treasury said Government remains committed to:"To this end and as acknowledged by Fitch economic growth is expected to be higher this year than in 2016 then rising further over the medium-term."We urge all South Africans to remain positive and continue to work hard in turning this economy around. This country has tremendous potential by working together we can make South Africa an increasingly attractive investment destination."
