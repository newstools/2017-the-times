In the recent past with coaches like Muhsin Ertugral and Augusto Palacios at the helm Pirates fans often blamed the team for being too individualistic.The Bucs were accused of relying heavily on players like Oupa Manyisa and Thabo Rakhale.Wome said Jonevret who has been in the country for almost three weeks after replacing Ertugral is working on inculcating the spirit of teamwork and they are now playing for each other rather that focusing on individuals. We have been working very well with the new coach and we are starting to understand his new methods " said Wome on Thursday."I can say that he is doing well at training and he is starting to know us and our strengths and he is lifting the team spirit."He has changed some things around for us and the players are also beginning to understand his methods which is important."Wome added that one of the major things that Jonevret is instilling is for them to play like a team. We are going to defend and attack together as a team " he said."This is the type of football that we will be playing and not individual style that we used to play sometimes in the past. Wome has been in good form since he joined Pirates from SuperSport United in January and he scored a crucial goal for the Bucs in the tense Absa Premiership encounter against Cape Town City recently. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
