The abalone was found after police received a tip-off. A 42-year-old Crawford man was arrested. Members on patrol received information of a suspect loading abalone at the back of a funeral parlour in Protea Road Philippi East and proceeded to the address to investigate said police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Andr Traut. On the scene the suspect was found packing abalone into freezers and he was arrested. The abalone comprising 260 bags weighing approximately 20kg each were confiscated as well as the truck which was used to transport the abalone. We are investigating the possibility that this truck was stolen. Once charged the suspect is due to make a court appearance in Athlone. - TMG Digital/TimesLIVE
