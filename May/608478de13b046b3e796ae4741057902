Richard Henry Patterson, 65, of Margate, Broward County in Florida, United States, admits to choking his girlfriend, Francisca Marquinez, 60, but says that it was an accident and that showing the jury his penis will prove it.A local Florida newspaper, Sun Sentinel, reported that Patterson called his lawyer, Ken Padowitz, before police discovered the body.The victim had already been dead for between eight and 24 hours and was in an early stage of decomposition.The publication reports that due to decomposition it is difficult to detect if there were bruises on her neck and that the medical examiner was unable to reach a definitive conclusion about the cause and manner of death. It is also reported that Patterson told his daughter he did something bad. He later told a friend, I choked her. I choked Francisca.
