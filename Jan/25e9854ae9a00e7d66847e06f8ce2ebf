Nel who has tendered his resignation to his boss Advocate Sibongile Mzinyathi the director of public prosecutions in Pretoria is said to be in the process of joining a private prosecuting team which is to be established by AfriForum.Their goal will be individuals who have been allowed to escape prosecution by the National Prosecuting Authority.While AfriForum's chief executive Kallie Kriel would neither deny nor confirm that Nel was to join the team TimesLIVE has learnt from independent sources that the team's establishment and members will be announced by AfriForum later today."They are just waiting for Nel to take his final walk out of his office " said a source.On the independent prosecution team is said to be top private forensic investigator Paul O'Sullivan.O'Sullivan has been instrumental in driving anti-corruption investigations into some of South Africa's top government officials.These include the likes of disgraced former national police commissioner Jackie Selebi who was convicted of corruption. It was Nel who led the prosecution of Selebi.Those that will also be on the team's radar are said to include the likes of the Gupta family and those within their business network which allegedly includes top government officials President Jacob Zuma and his family.Even the president himself could be a target of the private prosecutions team.The NPA boss Advocate Shaun Abrahams is yet to make a decision on whether Zuma is to be prosecuted for corruption. The president currently has over 700 corruption charges hanging over his head relating to the controversial arms deal.Sources with knowledge of the team have said others who could also very soon be pursued are South African Airways chairwoman Dudu Myeni who has been under pressure over some of her decisions and the poor financial performance of the state-owned airline disgraced police crime intelligence boss Lieutenant-General Richard Mdluli and Hawks head Berning Ntlemeza who is mired in controversy.In 2015 Ntlemeza was found to be a liar and a person who lacked integrity by Judge Elias Matojane who was ruling on the unlawful suspension of former Gauteng Hawks boss Shadrack Sibya. Of late Ntlemeza has faced strong criticism over his pursuit of Independent Police Investigative Directorate boss Robert McBride and his attempts to oust him from office.Ntlemeza has been accused of interfering in the Directorate's investigations and doing the bidding of politicians over the investigations into Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan.- TMG Digital/TimesLIVE
