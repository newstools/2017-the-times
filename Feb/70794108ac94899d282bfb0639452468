What do they expect them to do " the flyer reads."Where must South Africans work?"The flyer also accuses foreign residents from Nigeria Zimbabwe and Pakistan of destroying Johannesburg.On Monday the Nigerian government urged the African Union to step in to stop what it said were "xenophobic attacks" on its citizens and other Africans in South Africa.AFP reported that the Nigerian presidency said there was a need for the continental body to "intervene urgently " claiming that in the last two years "about 116" Nigerians had been killed including 20 last year."This is unacceptable to the people and government of Nigeria " a senior presidential aide on foreign affairs Abike Dabiri-Erewa said in an emailed statement to AFP.
