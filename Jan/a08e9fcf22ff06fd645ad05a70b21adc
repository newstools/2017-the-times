Institute for Security Studies expert on counterterrorism Martin Ewi was commenting on a Sunday Times report that said a bomb-maker working for IS, an Iraqi named Abu Osama, was arrested at a Turkish airport last month as he was about to board a flight to Johannesburg.The newspaper also reported that on December 16 immigration officials at OR Tambo International Airport flagged another suspected terrorist entering South Africa from Turkey.The man, who was originally from the US, was sent back to Turkey. Ewi said this was not the first time South Africa had been linked to threats of a terrorist attack."Since 2014 we have been hearing news about South Africa's vulnerability to terrorism."Last year South Africa arrested South Africans who were planning to attack US interests in the country."Ewi warned that there could be more terrorists, adding that there could be a back-up plan."We need to investigate and get to know whether there are more terrorists planning to come to South Africa."Ewi said from what had been seen in IS operations the jihadist group was using local operatives to perpetrate terror attacks."We need to find out whether there are locals involved."Ewi said he was encouraged that State Security Minister David Mahlobo had denied claims he was delaying signing a memorandum of understanding with Iraq on sharing information.By signing co-operation agreements with countries such as Iraq and Turkey, South Africa would be able to follow the trends and the movements of terrorists, he said."It is high time South Africa cooperated with countries involved in fighting IS. If we don't, something could surprise us."Ewi expressed satisfaction at a statement by Mahlobo that the country was taking terror seriously.
