The match was interrupted for about an hour as a swarm of bees descended on the pitch until part time beekeeper Pierre Hefner volunteered his services to remove them and allowed the match to continue without any loss of over.South African captain AB de Villiers won the toss and chose to field and his bowlers ripped through the Sri Lankan line-up with efficiency to put the Proteas in a good position.The Proteas made two changes to the team that beat Sri Lanka in Durban on Wednesday with batsman Farhaan Behardien replacing injured David Miller and fast bowler Dwaine Pretorius coming on for Wayne Parnell.Sri Lanka handed debuts to Lahiru Madushanka and Lahiru Kumara and it turned out to be a baptism of fire as the former was bowled out without scoring and the latter contributed only five runs.Sri Lanka started brightly and they reached the 50 runs mark with openers Upul Tharanga and Niroshan Dickwella contributing 24 and 23 runs respectively as Proteas bowlers Kagiso Rabada Chris Morris and Dwaine Pretorius and JP Duminy struggled to make the breakthrough.South African bowlers continued to pile pressure on the openers and they were duly rewarded after 12 overs when Dwaine Pretorius caught Tharanga s top edged effort at fine leg from Rabada s short ball.The wicket served as a much needed consolation for JP Duminy who dropped enterprising Sri Lankan batsman Dickwella with the previous ball much to the dismay of the packed Bullring.Sri Lanka soon lost their second wicket when experienced Kusal Mendis edged Andlile Phehlukwayo s good length delivery outside offstump to Hashim Amla who produced a stunning catch at first slip.Phehlukwayo s wicket came in the last ball of his first over where he had only conceded five runs as South Africa began to deal with the Sri Lankan top order that struggled in the opening two matches in Port Elizabeth and Durban.Phehlukwayo struck again for his second wicket of the day a few overs later with a fuller delivery outside offstump that lured Dinesh Chamdimal whose drive on his knees went straight to Morris who was stationed at sweeper cover for a catch.Morris turned out wicket taker when he removed Dhananjaya de Silva whose thick outside edge found Amla for his second catch of the day as Sri Lanka slumped to 115/4 inside 25 overs. The fifth wicket for Sri Lanka fell when Asela Gunaratne s shot found Pretorius at third man from the bowling of Rabada who registered his second wicket of the innings as South Africa continued to rip through the middle order.Sri Lankan wickets continued to tumble and this time it was highly promising opener Dickwella for an impressive 74 who was caught by Quinton de Kock for his 100th catch in ODIs from the bowling of Pretorius.Then Faf du Plessis produced one of his special one-handed catches to remove debutant Lahiru Madushanka for a duck at second slip from the bowling of Pretorius for his second of the day.Lakmal followed from the bowling of Pretorius third wicket while Tahir completed the rout with the late wickets of Pathirana and Kumara.- TMG Digital/TMG Sport
