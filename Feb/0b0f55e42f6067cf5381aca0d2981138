The national executive director of the embattled organisation Peter Cloete said they were planning to send food parcels to their employees across the country many of whom are working from home.On Monday The Times reported that the organisation which helps to protect an estimated two million children is on the brink of collapse and it hasn't been able to pay 70 employees for two months.Joan van Niekerk from the International Society for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect said the closure of Child Welfare SA would leave children in "grave danger"."We certainly can't afford to do away with Child Welfare. They are a vital cog in child protection services " she told The Times.The organisation has been on a financial precipice since 2012 when its funders - the US Agency for International Development the Murray Trust and the National Lottery Distribution Trust Fund - ended their support "due to a lack of financial transparency reporting and accountability".Cloete denied reports that Johannesburg employees are on strike."They're not on strike. They just don't have funds to come in so what we are trying to do is arrange for one of the Child Welfare vehicles to pick them up. They just don't have the transport money to come in at the moment " he said.He said staff from other branches are also working from home and are in contact with head office."There is no direct consultation. They work with member organisations and the head office staff are tied to different administrative things " said Cloete.He said the food parcels would consists of "the basics " as well as sanitary products.Cloete conceded that he did not know when they would have funds available to pay salaries again. - TMG Digital/The Times
