We cannot have a national dialogue on a way forward more especially with somebody like De Klerk who is a murderer who has killed our people. He cannot be here and tell us how to take the country forward. He shouldn t be part of this arrangement. He is a murderer Novela said.He said the EFF was not going to disrupt the dialogue. But it should be having the correct panellists those who have the interest of the people and country at heart. De Klerk is not one of those people. He shouldn t be part of that panel in the first place he concluded. The group staged a silent protest at the conference venue during the lunch break. Members carried placards saying "De Klerk should be charged with genocide against blacks".The party also issued a statement rejecting the initiative arguing that the gathering was repetition of the talks that ushered in a democratic South Africa.The EFF members did not participate in the 10 breakaway groups to determine the issues and challenges facing the country. They instead remained in the main conference hall. #NationalDialogue event is over but EFF is here. They're singing, "De Klerk is sh**." pic.twitter.com/TgzHZEODNW
