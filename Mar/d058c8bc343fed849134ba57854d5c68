He is a 23 year old who uses a wheelchair due to spinal cord tumor. He sent a Facebook inbox saying his wish was to meet me and he couldn't go to my gigs because he's in a wheelchair," Fifi explained.She said that Olebogeng had not expected a reply to the message. So imagine his surprise when his idol showed up at his house."He couldn't believe it.. Dreams do come true!...I'm glad I made someone's day," Fifi said of her visit.
