A few days after Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane said City would win the league his Wits counterpart Gavin Hunt has said the same thing.Hunt told Times Media Digital that the distraction of participating in Confederation of African Football (Caf) competitions will eventually catch up with title hopefuls Sundowns Wits and SuperSport United and it will play into City s hands. If you ask me who s got the best run-in I would say Cape Town City Hunt said. They have got the best run-in. They have got all the big games at home. They ve got Chiefs at home and us (Wits) at home. The longer SuperSport stay in Caf the longer Sundowns stay in Caf and the longer we stay in Caf the harder it will be for us. Pitso said something the other day and he is right. No Champions League for City. City s title credentials will certainly be put to the test in the coming weeks and it helps that Tinkler won his second Absa premiership coach of the month award on Monday.Tinkler was voted as coach of the month for March while Wits defender and captain Thulani Hlatshwayo walked away with the player of the month accolade.Second-placed Wits are one point behind City but Hunt s charges have two games in hand.The Clever Boys will return to the top of the table and knock City off their perch if they are able to beat Golden Arrows at Bidvest Stadium on Tuesday night.It s a game Hunt will be desperate to win as they cannot afford to drop anymore points given the twists and turns of this title race.Tuesday s fixtures:Chippa United vs Polokwane City at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium (7:30pm) Orlando Pirates vs Maritzburg United at Orlando Stadium (7:30pm) Bidvest Wits vs Golden Arrows at Bidvest Stadium (7:30pm)Baroka FC vs Free State Stars at Peter Mokaba Stadium (7:30pm) - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
