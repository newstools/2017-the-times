 Siwelele confirmed that Vuyisile Wana Robert Sankara Ayanda Dlamini and Moeketsi Mvula have been released and they are free to join clubs of their choice next season.Celtic finished fifth from the bottom in the Absa Premiership and their safety was only confirmed on the last day of the campaign after they earned a point in their 1-1 draw with Maritzburg City at Harry Gwala Stadium. We are earnestly looking to revamp the team and have released some players based on the recommendations of the technical team " said Celtic chief executive Khumbulani Konco."We have subsequently added new players whose names will soon be announced once negotiations have been finalised by their respective teams."The past season was not only tumultuous but made us react promptly towards building a solid and competent squad for the 2017/2018 season. It is the nature of the industry unfortunately some players will leave to pave way the way for the new signings."We genuinely appreciate the contribution made by the players in helping the team to avoid the axe and wish them all the best in their future endeavours."We value our supporters and it is important that we strengthen the team through proper restructuring he said. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
