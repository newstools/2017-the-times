In its findings‚ Disciplinary Committee noted that this was a serious violation by Jomo Cosmos as safety and security is a critical component of staging a match.

They were fined R500 000 with R400 000 suspended for a period of 12 months on proviso that they are not found guilty of a similar offence within that period on issues of safety and security compliance.
