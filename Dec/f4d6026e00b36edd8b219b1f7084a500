The impact caused the seat to fly back and hit the child. He was such a sweet boy...we had been with them in the afternoon and I was playing with him‚” he said. “They were both killed instantly. We are told that this is not the first time that this has happened on that stretch of road and we are hoping something will be done about it‚” he added. “We are just so traumatised and everyone is completely shaken‚” he said. Police are investigating an inquest docket following the rock throwing attack. No arrests have been made.
