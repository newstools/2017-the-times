Speaking to TimesLive chairperson of the Gauteng Meter Association Reuben Mzayiya said the fight against Uber was far from over and meter taxi associations would do everything in their power to squash Uber. The reality is we don t want it but we have partnered with an IT company so that we can counter the App. We have realised that chasing and beating Uber drivers will land us with criminal records. Mzayiya said meter taxi operators as well as business partners would be meeting on Tuesday to discuss the App.Hundreds of meter taxi drivers marched to the national transport department in Tshwane on Wednesday demanding the expulsion of Uber.Metered taxi operators in the country's cities have been up in arms against Uber for many months now. They argue private taxis which are using an American phone application to pick up commuters are forcing them out of business. Meter taxis are very sensitive and we are dealing with people who from overseas and Uber is defiant and don t want to engage with us. What we cannot allow is this intrusion because Uber just came here without negotiating with us said Mzayiya We don t condone violence and I was in Pretoria and the reality is that in a situation like this it is difficult to control our members. The war against Uber will continue and in actual fact it is just the start Mzayiya said.Several calls to the Gauteng Department of Transport for comment were unsuccessful.
