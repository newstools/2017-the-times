An emotional Amor struggled to hold back tears as she took a trip down memory lane. She reflected on how appropriate it was that Joost's final send-off was at Loftus Versveld Stadium, because it was a place he called "home".Amor described their love story as a "fairytale"."He swept me off my feet, together we travelled the world and made wonderful memories. He challenged me to live life to the fullest and for a time I was living my fairytale," said Amor.She added that their fairytale was challenged but the bond they shared because of their children was unbreakable."Jordan and Kylie were, and are, the most important tie that we share. The love for our children bound us together. I won't lie that I'm scared of raising our children alone. But I have to help them find the best of their father in them, it is what Joost would have wanted," she said.Amor told their children how much of their dad they had in them. "He showed you how to be a fighter. He gave you so much more that will live on with you forever."The singer said she believed Joost fought so fiercely over the past seven years for their children. Amor read out a moving tribute from the children to Joost, who promised to honour their dad."I'm sure Joost is sprinting down some green rugby field, he is free from his disease and the body that tested him so cruelly. Thank you Joost for being my first love, our fairytale, and for the most precious gift Kylie and Jordan. Now you are celebrating your victory with the angels in heaven and God."
