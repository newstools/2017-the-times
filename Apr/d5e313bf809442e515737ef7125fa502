Mashaba is challenging his dismissal but it emerged late yesterday afternoon that the former Bafana mentor, Safa CEO Dennis Mumble, and CCMA commissioner Hlalele Molotsi met to discuss the possibility of settling the long-running saga out of court.Safa tabled an initial offer of R1-million (two months' salary) yesterday morning before the start of the proceedings, but Mashaba and his legal team declined the amount, insisting on the equivalent of six months' salary (R3-million).When they couldn't reach an agreement, negotiations continued.But it appears there is a thaw in relations between the two parties as Mashaba's lawyer, Claudio Bollo, and Safa's Mark Thompson confirmed that the discussions were continuing."The parties are talking to see if we can't resolve the case amicably," said Bollo. "The meeting was to see if there could be a possible solution to the case and negotiations will continue while we are continuing with the case."Thompson echoed Bollo and said the idea was to meet each other halfway and end a saga that began with Mashaba's sacking in December."Definitely there were settlement talks that are common with these proceedings but we could not find each other," Thompson said."Matters like these are never off the table and in the spirit of reconciliation the parties must always look to see where they can find each other."Asked about the possibility of reaching a settlement with Mashaba soon, Mumble did not want to dwell on the matter."It is not something that I want to comment on as you can see that the case is going on," Mumble said."We don't want to compromise the case by speculating on which direction it would take."Let the process follow a particular course and if there are discussions about a settlement we will face those discussions and deal with them."The saga could be concluded sooner than expected after Mumble has communicated with his principals at Safa House.It seems Mashaba and Safa do not want to drag the matter further and they appear to be interested in a speedy resolution to this hearing. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
