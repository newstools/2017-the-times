Mahlangu had sat out the past month through injury ending his hopes of a Bafana recall after some good form for Dinamo this season.He was back for the Romanian Cup quarterfinal penalty shoot-out defeat at the hands of Universitatea Craiova on Wednesday night and is now looking forward to a clash with bitter city rivals Steaua Bucharest on Saturday as both sides remain in the hunt for the league title. We all know what it means to play against Steaua. Is the game that we all want to win it Mahlangu said before adding he was feeling fully fit following his injury troubles. I worked hard I'm sure the coach saw it I'm happy that I was given the opportunity to do my best in this match."So I feel much better than before. Dinamo are out of the main cup competition in Romania but have made the final of the League Cup the equivalent of the Telkom Knockout.They defeated Steaua over two legs in the semifinals with Mahlangu having an eventful first leg in which he netted a fine opener on 19 minutes before limping off injured shortly afterwards to spend the next month out.Mahlangu signed a three-year deal with Dinamo in September having been a free agent following his departure from Belgian side Sint Truiden at the end of last season.Mahlangu is a product of the Stars of Africa Academy and also played for Alexandra United.He moved to Swedish side Helsingborg in 2008 when he was still a teenager and looked set to be a major star in Europe but a bad Achilles tendon injury in 2013 set back his ambitions.He was named Swedish League Player of the Year in 2011 while with Helsingborg.He won the last of his 17 international caps against Burkina Faso in the World Cup qualifier in October last year. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
