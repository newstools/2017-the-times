The Sowetan reported on Monday that Mpumalanga premier David Mabuza was contemplating bringing back the red berets leader because the party was weaker without Malema. I myself am considering bringing Malema back into the ANC. I am following him. He might be talking too much but it is better if he spoke like that in the ANC. When I bring him back you must welcome him " Mabuza told members of the ANC Youth League on Sunday.Mabuza who also chairs the ANC in the province was speaking at the Youth League s provincial general council (PGC) in Mbombela.EFF spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said Malema was not going anywhere."DD (David Dadebe) Mabuza is using the name of the CIC (commander-in-chief) to try and get coverage in the news because he [Mabuza] doesn t represent anything. He wants to create a profile towards his ambitions to lead the ANC in their national conference added Ndlozi.The ANC will hold its national conference in December when new leadership will be elected.
