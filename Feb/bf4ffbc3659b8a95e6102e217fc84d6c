Vuyisile Poni was allegedly stabbed to death by her husband Mzuvukile on January 2. He applied for bail on Tuesday in the Wynberg Magistrate s Court and admitted to stabbing her in Westlake. Steenkamp's cousin Kim Martin said the late model would have wanted them to be at court instead of scattering flowers on a beach to remember her. Martin is spokeswoman of the Reeva Rebecca Steenkamp Foundation which supports victims of violence and abuse. Being Valentine's Day it is obviously a very important day for the Steenkamp family. This [supporting Vuyisile's family and friends] is a more honourable way to honour Reeva today. To be here is exactly what Reeva would have wanted us to do said Martin.Steenkamp was shot to death by her boyfriend Olympic athlete Oscar Pistorius on Valentine s Day in 2013. Mzuvukile admitted stabbing his wife but said he had not been told how she died. He told the court he wanted bail because he needed to return to work. He had three children and one of them was in hospital with complications following a liver transplant he said. More than 1 000 people have signed a petition opposing bail. Vuyisile's best friend Nicole Elliot said the dead woman had sued for divorce. They hadn t been living together for several years Elliott said. He moved to Joburg. Nkololeko Badini the family's neighbour said there were many cases of domestic abuse in the area. But the problem is that many women are too afraid to speak out. We want the women to know that the men support them she said. The matter was postponed to March 14. - TMG Digital/The Times
