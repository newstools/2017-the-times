Sharpen your meat-tasting skills and join us for a braai where we will subject South Africa's favourite cuts from five supermarket chains to the taste-and-tell-all test. On the menu will be boerewors, chops, steak and pork ribs, along with a selection of braai accompaniments, that require your expert opinion. All tasters will be asked to do a blind tasting and score the different meats and accompaniments. An expert braai master will prepare the food. All tasters will go home with a copy of the latest Sunday Times Cookbook as a thank-you. This invitation is open to people 18 and older and please note there is pork on the menu. When? Saturday, September 30, from 10am - 12 noon in Randburg, Johannesburg. Interested? E-mail your name and contact details to Philantu Nkanunu, nkanunuP@tisoblackstar.co.za Space is limited to 40 tasters; if you don't hear from us, unfortunately it means you missed the cut.
