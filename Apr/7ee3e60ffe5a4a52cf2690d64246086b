The win which handed the Chiefs a crucial bonus point and moved them to the top of standings was the Bulls fourth loss of the campaign after five matches and they face a difficult task to get their campaign back on track.Since the beginning of the season the Bulls have lost to the Stormers Cheetahs Blues and the Chiefs with their only win against the Sunwolves who they meet in the next match in Japan on Saturday.For about 55 minutes against the Chiefs the Bulls looked a different side from the one that lost four matches as they played attractive and attacking rugby only to be let down by not converting their dominance into tries.The Bulls went to the break leading the Chiefs 9-3 from the boot of Handre Pollard but they could not withstand the pressure from their hosts who roared back in the second half with three unanswered tried from Shaun Stevenson Damian McKenzie and Atunaisa Moli. There were too many crucial mistakes from us we lost on the lineout they attacked us from there to score and that gave them momentum and belief said disappointed Marais after the match. Unfortunately if you have momentum and belief you become difficult to stop. At one stage we had something like 50 to 60 percent territory and we should have used opportunities better but it was a definitely much improved attacking performance. We were excellent on the attack in the first half if we could have converted some of those opportunities it might have been different and there were also a few opportunities in the second half. Marais admitted that with four losses after five matches it is going to be difficult to bounce back in the competition but he takes comfort in the fact that the Bulls have matches at home after playing against the Sunwolves next weekend. We have one more away game and we play a lot of games at home. I think the guys are looking forward to that and we just have to make sure that we win our home games. It is going to be difficult with on one out of five he said.ScorersChiefs :Tries: Shaun Stevenson Damian McKenzie Atunaisa MoliConversions: Aaron Cruden (2)Penalties: Cruden (3)BullsPenalties: Handre Pollard (4)- TMG Digital/TMG Sport
