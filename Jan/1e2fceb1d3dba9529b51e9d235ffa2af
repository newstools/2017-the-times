Basic Education for All has claimed that there was a shortage of 40,000 books across schools in the province last year.Befa spokesman Tebogo Sepha-kgamela said yesterday the body was concerned that the situation would persist because the department had failed to address the problem.He said the information was gathered from Basic Education for All's hotline, by field workers who visited schools, as well as interviews with pupils and parents across all five districts of Limpopo.Sephakgamela said some schools had textbook shortages for maths, geography and physical science.Last year the body discovered that there was a shortage of 10,000 units in 18 schools in the Vhembe district."This is serious. The problem will continue in 2017 and it will cause even more problems," Sephakga-mela said.He said the NGO had also made efforts to meet the department regarding their findings but had received no response.Education department spokes-man Naledzani Rasila slammed the allegations yesterday."Our shortages remained those of infrastructure and furniture."We never received any reports or complaints of shortages with textbooks. Even this year we will not have a shortage, but we are likely to have a delay," he said.Rasila said the department had already started delivering textbooks and learning material ahead of the reopening of schools today.
