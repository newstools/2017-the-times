The local community policing forum which has been trying to calm the situation down since Monday is worried about the destruction of property and the looting of the very same stores that they buy from."As community leaders we have had enough of what's been happening. Between yesterday and today the situation has become out of control and chaotic and we know that now we are just dealing with a criminal element " said Cheryl Pillay chairperson of the Eldorado Park Local Drug Action Committee."The looting has escalated to a point where us as the community we have to stand together to try and protect each other's property " she said.Pillay said they wanted the government to urgently address the community issues because it was clear that they would not back down.Community members are demanding land to build houses and want government s intervention as soon as possible.Protesters mostly teenagers have looted a few Eldorado Park BP garages and destroyed properties.On Monday local Spar shops in extension two and extension eight were looted. A Pep store as well as a Shoprite store in Freedom Park were also looted by protesters.Police are monitoring the situation and have fired rubber bullets at the protesters.
