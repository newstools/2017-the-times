The star shared her thoughts on Valentine's Day with fans through a lengthy blog post. Pearl surprised us when she revealed that she's not actually a big fan of roses on Valentine's. Like, for real."I don t even like roses. No one should be giving me dead bodies as a gift, no matter how pretty they look. Give me a plant with roots and soil and stuff."I won t say no to roses or any other flower, they re beautiful, but please don t assume I should be extremely excited. I just think, 'congratulations, you just played yourself. You wasted money!' The thought still counts though," Pearl wrote.She said that Valentine's Day was always stressful but that she was "calmer about it now".She also encouraged ladies to break with tradition and "do something insane" for their men on the day."Get him that latest PlayStation, listen to the frivolous needs of your man as well. When I say be 'grand', I mean be spectacular- but even and more particularly with the little things. Iron his shirt that morning even if you re not that kinda girl (note- but don t burn it honey). Just go out of your way."The truth is- while chivalry will always be welcomed, if we hope gender equality will be achieved, we must also level the playing field on these days," Pearl added.So, diamonds for Valentine's then, Pearl? via GIPHY
