The widow of late music promoter Prosper Mkwaiwa found her name in the headlines recently when a source told Move that she was six months pregnant.Tina has however denied the claims, telling TshisaLIVE that nothing could be further from the truth."That is the craziest thing I have ever heard. I am not pregnant. I have to find a man first. Mary, the mother of Jesus, was the only woman who could have a baby without sex," Tina saidTina, who recently released a new song, said that she was too busy trying to build her music career to be focused on motherhood."I lost everything and now I am trying to build myself and my career. I am focused a hundred percent on that and nothing else. I know the responsibilities that come with motherhood and I'm in no position to be pregnant."I am not going to say that it won't happen eventually but right now it is the furtherest thing from my mind," Tina said.
