In a statement issued on Tuesday afternoon SA Rugby said six representatives from the South African Super Rugby franchises agreed on the criteria that will determine how the four sides for next year's tournament will be decided.The criteria is as follows: economic and financial sustainability sustainable support base team performance and stadiums and facilities.The statement further said the criteria will be broken down into further subsections and measurement mechanisms that have been agreed upon.From that perspective it becomes clear the Southern Kings and the Cheetahs will be sacrificed at the Super Rugby altar as the tournament looks to find a semblance of credible competitiveness.In the light of the unwieldy 18-team tournament attracting plenty of criticism governing body SANZAAR decided on Sunday morning to cut two South African franchises and one Australian one.Which Australian franchise that will no longer exist is still up in the air.SA Rugby chief executive Jurie Roux said this was the best way for them to navigate the difficult waters the union finds itself in. We have reached this painful point partly because of over-optimism and partly because we have not always taken a hard-nosed business view of what is good for rugby."It is the right process with a challenging outcome for two of our franchises. They have all engaged in the process at the end of which the data will drive the conclusion."We have more work to do but we are moving the process along as swiftly as is possible Roux said. The committee looked at the key question of what are the fundamental criteria required to make a successful South African Vodacom Super Rugby franchise? - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
