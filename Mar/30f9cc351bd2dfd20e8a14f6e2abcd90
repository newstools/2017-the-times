Five people were injured when part of the roof over an entrance collapsed at the hospital on March2.A contractor was accused of negligence.Gauteng infrastructure MEC Jacob Mamabolo is expected to release the official findings into the incident in the next few days.Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi said at the time that "common sense" should have made it obvious that nothing heavy should have been put there.The contractors have been asked to leave the site but stones they piled up on a fifth- floor roof near the staff canteen have remained.Hospital employees are worried about the potential for another collapse.The Times spoke to three engineers who said it was not ideal to pile stones so high in one area, although they could not give an opinion in this instance because they had not assessed the structure and strength of the roof.Gauteng infrastructure department spokesman Theo Nkonki said that the stones would be removed today ."As a safety precaution the roof and structure there has been given extra support by means of propping ... to the structural engineer's satisfaction."A report into the roof collapse at the hospital was scheduled to be released by Mamabolo's office last week .
