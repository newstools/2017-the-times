Chippa United qualified for their first ever Nedbank Cup quarter finals after a hard-fought 2-0 victory over visiting Polokwane City at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth on Saturday afternoon. Second half goals from midfielders Buyani Sani and Andile Mbenyane gave the Chilli Boyz something to cheer about after a barren run in the league, which has seen the team win just one of their nine encounters.Both teams started the match on a rather low pace as they weighed each other in the opening minutes of the match.City had their chances to get something out of this match but were wasteful in front of goal with Thabang Klaass and Rodney Ramagalela the main culprits.City will have a chance to avenge the Cup defeat on Tuesday night when the two sides clash again in the Absa Premiership at the same venue. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
