This comes as COSATU have publicly endorsed Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa to succeed President Jacob Zuma whose term comes to an end in December."We have also noted the temptation and eagerness by some alliance partner to pronounce their preference on who should lead the ANC. The ANC has never interfered on how they elect their leadership and as such they must not attempt to interfere with the processes of the ANC " said ANCYL secretary general Njabulo Nzuza.He was addressing members of the media at St George Hotel in Irene Pretoria on Wednesday afternoon ahead of the party's lekgotla this weekend."The alliance is a strategic collaboration born out of [the] struggle to build a better life for our people and not leadership preferences. The alliance is meant to function as a critical instrument in the advancement of the National Democratic Revolution not leadership preference " added Nzuza.In November last year at Cosatu's central executive committee the federation said it would back Ramaphosa.Cosatu's general secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali said at the time that a decision had now been made."After intensive and robust debate the CEC resolved to support and lobby for the deputy president of the ANC comrade Cyril Ramaphosa to take over the reins as the next president of the ANC " he said.Ntshalintshali said they also support the proposal that the ANC should explore the possibility of avoiding slates and contestation at its next conference this year.
