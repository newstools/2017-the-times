The Orange Farm woman was the latest victim to speak out about what she endured at the hands a gun-wielding white Toyota Quantum gang that has become notorious in Gauteng.The woman s ordeal occurred on March 14 while she was on her way to work."I stopped a taxi and there were two men and the driver. Along the way the driver took the route to Southgate and I told him I was going to Booysens. The taxi stopped for a while and then they pulled out guns " she told the newspaper.They then drove for about one and a half hours."They asked for my pin code and bank card which I handed to them. The taxi stopped but I did not know where we were. When the door opened again I was beaten and kicked. I thought it was because I had no money. We then drove off. We arrived in a bush in Dube [Soweto] where I was raped by one of them and then dumped " she said.She managed to contact police with the help of local residents.Her story echoes cases that emerged this week.ActionAid South Africa urged government to protect women using public transport."Although pleased that Community Safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane has encouraged women to report rape we urge her and other duty bearers to take decisive action to protect women accessing transport and navigating our cities " the organisation said in a statement."We simply cannot place the responsibility on the survivors and those most at risk when it s too late. We must take preventative and protective measures thus AASA is calling on the MEC and local government to go beyond calling on women to report and to call on local governments and transport agencies to ensure transport systems planning and infrastructure serves women s needs and protect women s rights."We encourage officials to engage NGOs like AASA already working on ensuring safe cities for women to ensure a national campaign is taken forward."
