Amanda could not hide her excitement when she showed off her purchase. "Since I was young I used to try on my parents time pieces and always imagined owning statement watches. Today I purchased my first boss time piece. God has been beyond merciful," she said. The actress added that this was the first of many in her collection. "This may be my first but it definitely won't be my last-time is precious and I plan to invest in it a lot more," she added. Congrats Amanda!
