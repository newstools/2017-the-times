Her deputy, Bonginkosi Madikizela, will act as leader until February 25 when the party's provincial council - consisting of councillors, MPs and members of the provincial legislature - will elect an interim leader at its meeting in Worcester.DA Western Cape chairman Anton Bredell said the interim leader would take charge until an elective provincial congress is held. It is expected to sit around November.Bredell did not want to commit himself to dates, but party insiders say nominations could open as early as tomorrow , and close by the middle of next month.Contestation for the leadership position could be tough because the winner would have the inside track to become provincial premier when Helen Zille's term expires in 2019. De Lille will, however, stay on as member of the DA and City of Cape Town mayor. The reason she gave in her resignation letter to the party's national leader, Mmusi Maimane, was that she wanted to focus on her mayoral duties, to which she could not do justice while she was also provincial leader.
