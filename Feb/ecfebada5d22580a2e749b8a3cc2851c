Twitter erupted with questions after A-Reece, Fifi Cooper and B3nchmarq almost simultaneously took to social media to announce that they were cutting ties with the record label. Did opposition stable Mabala Noise poach them? Or was management stealing their money? Twitter detectives were out for answers!It wasn't long until some "files" surfaced on the matter, and even though some of the reasons behind the drama seemed like speculation, light was shed on a few issues.A publicist who seemed to have inside knowledge about the saga made damning allegations about the label. In a series of tweets Gasto Seremula accused Ambitiouz of unfair treatment, buying awards and corruption.DAMN!Ambitiouz quickly went on the defence. The stable decided to publicly air their dirty laundry with B3nchmarq but decided to withhold any information on A-Reece and Fifi Cooper, saying the matter might go to court.The artists however, have been very vocal about why they left. Fifi clapped back at a comment made by the stable that she abuses alcohol.How are we gonna buy drugs without money.. Lol https://t.co/FJ6lNgtWMpWe need to tell kids the truth .. They need to stop signing with this evil man.. Fuck @Ambitiouz_EntA-Reece decided not to let his fingers do the talking, instead he released a track titled Loyal, that touched on his reasons for leaving.This cuts in deep #Loyal by @reece_youngking pic.twitter.com/SVa6WkYjPH
