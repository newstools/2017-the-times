That's according to CPS CEO Serge Belamant in a letter filed with the Constitutional Court on Tuesday afternoon. He gave this warning in a letter to Sassa on Friday saying Wednesday was the latest day to finalise the CPS contract if grants were to paid on April 1.His letter was filed with the court on Tuesday only minutes after Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini defiantly told parliament that there was no crises with Sassa. She accused opposition parties of manufacturing the crisis as "mere self-serving propaganda and political grandstanding of the highest order".Yet in his letter court Belamant warns "CPS will not be in a position to commence payment on 1 April". Belamant writes: "It is imperative that Sassa understands the time frames required for the logistical planning with specific reference to the cash cycle. I attach hereto a schedule of the time frame as well as the activities to facilitate this planning and ensure uninterrupted grant delivery." He said he was extremely concerned about unavoidable and insurmountable delays.- TMG Digital
