But now the council is being investigated by the public protector because some of the members of the body's top management might not be qualified to do their jobs.Oupa Segalwe, senior communications manager for the public protector, confirmed that the office was investigating allegations of improper appointments at the council.EWN reported yesterday that it has "internal audit documents" that indicate that the council's chief financial officer, its chief operations officer and human resources officer were all appointed without the relevant qualifications .According to the report, the investigation was initiated after a whistleblower contacted the public protector's office.When asked for comment, council spokesman Thembinkosi Ndhlovu said: "Sace is co-operating fully with the public protector regarding the inquiry on appointments of senior personnel."The council has in the past taken a hard-line stance against teachers with fraudulent qualifications.
