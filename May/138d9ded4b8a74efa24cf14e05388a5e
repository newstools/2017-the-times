While Amakhosi have been uncharacteristically unenthusiastic under head coach Steve Komphela finishing a second season in a row without lifting any silverware they have been somewhat convincing when Molangoane has pulled the strings out on the wings.The former Orlando Pirates star has played a staggering 20 matches in all competitions for Chiefs scoring three goals and providing three assists since joining Amakhosi on a two-and-half-year deal from Chippa United on December 2 last year.Since making his debut off the bench in a 3-1 defeat at home to Chippa a day after his signing was announced Chiefs have lost just four matches out of the 20 in all Molangoane has played in.Reflecting on his first six months at Naturena the soft-spoken Alexandra-born attacking midfielder played down his role despite his encouraging statistics. To be honest it s been great being here at Kaizer Chiefs but the problem is that we were just unlucky Molangoane said ahead of Chiefs last match of the season at home to newly-crowned Premier Soccer League champions Bidvest Wits at FNB Stadium on Saturday.Asked about Chiefs record when he is in the team Molangoane said: I think it all boils down to hard work and how the team support each other. Chiefs had an improved second half of the 2016-17 PSL season at one stage going on a 12-match unbeaten streak with Molangoane one of the few standout performers in that run.Komphela s charges were in the running for the title until they failed to win in five of their last six fixtures of the season losing to Cape Town City Polokwane City Platinum Stars and drawing against SuperSport United and Golden Arrows.In fairness Amakhosi have dominated most of their opponents only for lapses of concentration at the back in the dying minutes of matches to derail their campaign. I think some games we played well but we were simply unlucky and there are other games where we ve just made silly mistakes. We conceded goals that we shouldn t have we missed opportunities we should have converted. Luck was not on our side mostly said Molangoane. Obviously it s not a nice feeling for us as players and the team not to have something to show for in our cabinet. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
