Pretoria high court judge Bashier Vally on Thursday ordered that Zuma dispatch records correspondence memorandums or any reports - including the so-called Intelligence report - related to the cabinet reshuffle within five days.The DA said it was elated by the ruling as it augured well for its main application to have Zuma's decision set aside on the basis that it was irrational and therefore unlawful.The party's federal executive chairman James Selfe said he was not sure what Zuma's next move would be under these circumstances. The important thing is that whatever reasons he provides he will be held to it in the subsequent review application. At his stage he simply says it was a political decision and we are going to test that political decision on the rationality of it and the effect it had on the country he said.Selfe said they want the main review application to be heard on an urgent basis possibly as soon as next month saying every passing day had more of a damaging effect on the economy as there was another rating agency that was still deliberating on whether to downgrade the country.Two rating agencies have already downgraded the country to junk status."We would hope that the court would play along with us that it deals with the irrationality as soon as possible " he said.Selfe who was in court said their main objective was that any future decisions by the president fulfilled his oath of office and promoted the interests of all south Africans.He said clearly Zuma s decision to appoint Malusi Gigaba as finance minister and the consequences of that were certainly not in the interests of 9-million unemployed South Africans and that reckless cabinet reshuffles were likely to result in many more people being unemployed."It is common cause that there was (an intelligence report) and was used as a reason for firing Gordhan and if the president does not produce that report we would want to know what happened to it and what was the approach to it because this application is that the president cannot come and invent reasons now with the benefit of an hindsight " Selfe added.-TMG Digital/TimesLIVE
