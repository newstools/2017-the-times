President Jacob Zuma is to remain in office after narrowly surviving the eighth motion of no confidence in his leadership on Tuesday night. The motion was defeated after 198 MPs voted against it, while 177 voted for Zuma to go – with nine abstentions. "The motion is accordingly negative‚" announced National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete. Speaking to ANC supporters at the gates of Parliament shortly after the results were announced‚ Police Minister Fikile Mbalula said Zuma was going nowhere. "Asijiki‚ we are not going to be told Zuma must go – if he must go, he will be removed by us as the ANC," he said. "We have defeated the useless motion. We can't dance to [Democratic Alliance leader] Mmusi Maimane and all the small boys and girls. People who vote with the motion are suicide bombers." In a statement‚ the ANC said it had reclaimed its position as leader of the society. "The ANC regards it as paramount that not just our elected representatives‚ but also all South Africans are able to engage on the most critical issues facing our country without fear or favour. "The biggest victor of today’s event is our constitutional dispensation. It once again reaffirms the ANC’s position as the leader of society in that the country’s MPs are able to exercise this critical constitutional provision aimed at safeguarding our democracy. "Whilst the ANC has consistently noted the numerous challenges facing our democracy as presented by the political opposition, at the same time we cannot lose sight of the record of success and achievement under the ANC government as presented by ANC MPs in today’s debate."
