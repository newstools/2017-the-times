About every three years these countries get together and each weather office sends a representative with a list of names. The Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre in Reunion which monitors the cyclone season then compiles an alphabetical list of names chosen from the submissions she said.Dineo which is the fourth tropical system of the 2016/2017 season was provided by Botswana and the gender is described as female.A full list is available in the Tropical Cyclone Operational Plan for the South-West Indian Ocean published by the World Meteorological Organization last year.Other countries which had name suggestions make the cut are Tanzania Mauritius Zimbabwe Lesotho Malawi Swaziland Tanzania Kenya and FranceSouth Africa is represented twice on the naming list with Bransby male and Violet female. Bransby which has already been used this season was named after the South African Weather Service senior forecaster Bransby Bulo.
