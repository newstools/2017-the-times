Two other suspects were arrested at the scene while another managed to escape and is being pursued said Hawks spokesperson Captain Dineo Lucy Sekgotodi.Sekgotodi said Hawks members had received information about a possible armed robbery to be carried out at a hardware store by an alleged armed gang in Vlakfontein Warbuton. Reinforcements which amongst others included the SAPS's National Intervention Unit TRT Witbank Crime Intelligence Ermelo and LCRC Ermelo were summoned to assist in the operation. True to the allegations four suspects were seen entering the targeted shop and allegedly produced firearms. One of the suspects noticed the police and started shooting at them. The police retaliated fatally wounding two suspects in the process. Two suspects were arrested on the scene whilst the fifth suspect fled and is currently being traced. A Mercedes Benz suspected to be a get-away vehicle as well as three pistols were seized Sekgotodi said.The identities of the deceased and the two arrested suspects had yet to be established however their profiling was already underway.
