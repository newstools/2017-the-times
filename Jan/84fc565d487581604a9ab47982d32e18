Times Media Digital has learnt that the Briton who is a former Bafana and Kaizer Chiefs coach is one of the candidates under discussion at Safa House.Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane was the strongest candidate a few weeks ago but his reluctance to leave the African champions in the middle of their purple patch is believed to have swung the pendulum in Baxter's favour.Given that Bafana are in the middle of qualifying for the 2018 World Cup and will begin qualifiers for the 2019 African Nations Cup in June Baxter's close proximity to South African football would allow him to hit the ground running and his appointment would be less risky.The United coach and his representatives could not be reached for comment on Thursday afternoon.Baxter who only joined United in the beginning of last year is no stranger to the national team as he coached Bafana between 2004 and 2005.But he quit the tough job in November 2005 after he failed to qualify the side for the 2006 Soccer World Cup.He has since gone on to enjoy considerable domestic success including two league championships in three years at Chiefs as well as a Nedbank Cup victory with SuperSport last May.Safa CEO Dennis Mumble told Times Media Digital a few weeks ago the next Bafana coach must have a deep well of continental football experience and must also be equipped with an intimate understanding of South African football its players and its landscapa.Mashaba was fired last month after he was found guilty of several charges including gross misconduct and insubordination.The former Bafana coach is challenging his dismissal and has taken his case to the Commission for Conciliation Mediation and Arbitration.Another former Bafana boss Carlos Queiroz threw his hat in the ring a few days ago.But Queiroz is still contracted to Iran despite serving notice to that country s federation of his desire to resign earlier this month citing a lack of support for his preparation plans for the World Cup qualifiers later this year.While he has reportedly voiced his interest in the job his mammoth salary and Iran's reluctance to release him without a fight puts him at a disadvantage.Former England coach Roy Hodgson Ruud Krol and many others have all been linked to the job since Mashaba's sacking last month.Baxter described the national team coaching position as interesting recently but he has not been drawn on whether he would be interested in a return to the hot-seat.He won 10 of his 23 games in charge of Bafana first time round drawing six and losing seven.He would be a lot more wiser this time and most certainly not repeat the criticism he directed at his former employers in his final weeks as Bafana coach in 2005.He said at the time there was a glaring neglect of certain issues that contributed to the national team's poor performances at the time. If you ask questions about the national coach you must also ask questions about the direction SA s football is taking he said at the time. There are massive problems that have not been addressed and led to Bafana Bafana moving from being a powerhouse to where we are right now. - TMG Digital
