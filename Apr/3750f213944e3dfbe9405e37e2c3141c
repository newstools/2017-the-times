Following Saturday s 5-3 Nedbank Cup quarterfinal penalties defeat against SuperSport United at FNB Stadium Chiefs have the Absa Premiership left to play for in 2016-17.Komphela s team are in third place in the PSL on 46 points from 24 games and have a crucial match against leaders Cape Town City away on Tuesday night.City are just a point ahead of Chiefs on the same number of games.Komphela s concern in terms of the title race though might come more from second-placed Bidvest Wits who also have 45 points but have played two games less than Amakhosi or City. We came into the match (against SuperSport) knowing that we have it in our hands. We could dictate or determine our own fate (in the Nedbank) Komphela said. And unfortunately nobody will remember that we missed a penalty in extra time and that we missed a penalty in the shootout. And that we got knocked out through penalties. It s unfortunate and disappointing obviously. Now turning all that to the league championship the sad part of it is that we still have to depend on other people dropping points. The Nedbank was better off because when you could go on you did not depend on somebody else s results. So it s all about now having to change focus and hope that somebody else will drop their points. But we have no margin for error. We just have to keep winning our matches. The first one is now on Tuesday. And on the back of this the biggest challenge would be how do you lift the players up and help them refocus and look into the championship. Chiefs meet City at Cape Town Stadium. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
