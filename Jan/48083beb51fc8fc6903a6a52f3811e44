The party s national executive committee (NEC) has decided to consolidate branch nominations nationally and not at regional and provincial levels as was previously the case.According to a statement after an NEC lekgotla read out by secretary general Gwede Mantashe on Monday ANC branches would be able to nominate their preferred candidates for leadership uninhibited.The move is also intended as a measure against the practice of slate politics where processes of the party are deliberately undermined to deliver a manufactured leadership outcome.Regional and provincial leaders would effectively be reduced to mere observers of the nomination process.In line with the 2016 [National General Counci] resolution that the branch is the basic unit of the ANC that slates must be outlawed and that serious action must be taken to prevent and deal with the practice of slates the NEC resolved to do away with the practice of consolidating nominations for leadership at a regional and provincial level. All nomination for leadership from branches will be consolidated nationally by the Electoral Commission said Mantashe reading from the statement.He continued: Regions and provinces can observe. The reason we are taking this route is because if we don t do this we are going to have nominations driven by slates. Mantashe explained that once branches had completed their nominations those would be sealed and consolidated at a central point .The decision by the NEC comes in the wake of the rise of a formidable faction colloquially known as the Premier League - comprising North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo David Mabuza of Mpumalanga and Ace Magashule of Free State.They are backed up by the ANC youth league and the women s league in their preference for outgoing African Union Commission Chairperson Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma as the next president of the ANC.Opposing them is a faction that wants Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa to succeed President Jacob Zuma in December. Ramaphosa s leadership ambitions have found support from labour federation Cosatu although its members can only propel him to the ANC presidency using their party membership.However Mantashe dismissed the names being bandied about in relation to the party s succession race as mere products of speculation. He said they would only become official contenders if they were to be nominated by branches of the ANC.-TMG Digital/TimesLIVE
