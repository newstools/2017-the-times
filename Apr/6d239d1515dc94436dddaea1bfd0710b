A team from Citrus Research International, in Nelspruit, is i nve st i g at i n g the problem which threatens to halve the harvest. In my 19 years in the industry I have never seen anything like this said Snyman Kritzinger a farmer in the Gamtoos Valley, in the Eastern Cape on the industry website FreshPlaza. The loss of early and mid-season navel oranges is expected to reduce exports of 15kg cartons by between 15% and 20%. The original export estimate was 26.3 million cartons. At first we thought the harvest might be 30% lower but now we re thinking it might be 50% down said Hannes de Waal MD of the Sundays River Citrus Company.He said it was the first time in living memory that something like this had happened on such a scale. The skin of affected oranges splits, leading to infections and the fruit dropping off the tree. Citrus Research International s Hannes Bester blamed the disaster on the drought: For a while now nature hasn t been playing along. In the past 18 months we have had half our usual rainfall.
