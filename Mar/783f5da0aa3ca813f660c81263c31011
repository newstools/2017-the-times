While the image of the country will no doubt take a beating after this week's events some of us will not shed a tear after missing out and we're actually planning to put on party hats and blow whistles at the news.Five reasons why losing the bid is actually a good thing1) The billions that would have been used in Durban could be allocated to NSFAS and other important government service delivery projectsSouth African institutions of higher learning burned last year as tertiary students embarked on the at times violent #FeesMustFall protests.Now that South Africa will no longer be hosting the event a bit of spare change has suddenly become available and it could be directed towards National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) funding and other service delivery programmes.2) White elephantsSporting infrastructure could have been improved in Durban but major events often leave behind a legacy of white elephants.Hell a number of municipalities around the country are still struggling to maintain some of the stadiums that were built for the 2010 Fifa World Cup.3) Tender corruption and irregular spending avoidedCorruption and irregular spending are never too far away from the organisation of major events and given that the Games would have cost more than R8-billion Lord knows what was about to go down in Durban.It's bad enough that you and me forked out nearly R120-million during the bidding process when we were the sole bidders.4) South Africa had not started building any infrastructureThough South Africa had already spent between R100 and R120 million on the bidding processes fortunately the local organizing committee had not been established and no infrastructure had been built yet.Initially South Africa had committed to spending around R4 billion to stage the event and then the costs started to climb at the speed of a Gautrain.5) It looks like the South African government is being careful about tax payers moneyGovernment s refusal to accede to some of the demands made by the Commonwealth Games Federation at least gives an impression that they are finally handling tax payer s money a bit more carefully. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
