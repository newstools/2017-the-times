Joost was admitted on Saturday morning in a critical condition. Sources close to the rugby legend said family had gathered at the hospital fearing the worst."They are all praying. Everyone is fearing the worst but there is always hope. They know Joost is a fighter," said one source close to Amor Vittone.There have been false reports that the former Springbok had died, but his foundation confirmed on Saturday night that he was "stable but critical."Joost was diagnosed with a form of MND in 2011 and has publicly fought the disease.In recent years he has been confined to a wheelchair and has battled to speak. He was recently put on an oxygen machine to help him breath and "sleep better."Joost's estranged wife Amor Vittone has also appealed for people to pray. She posted a picture to her Facebook page and said that everyone was together."Ek vra names die hele familie asb, om Joost in jul gebede te hou vandag. Ons almal is by mekaar vandag. Joost ons is lief vir jou!" (I'm asking on behalf of the whole family to keep Joost in your prayers. We are all together today," she wrote alongside a picture of herself with Joost and their two children.
