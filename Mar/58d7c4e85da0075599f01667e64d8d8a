Letsholonyane who was frozen out at the national team by former Bafana Bafana coach Shakes Mashaba says the reason he is yet to announce his retirement from international football is because he still harbours ambitions of wearing the national team jersey.The midfielder's name was missing from the latest Bafana squad announced by caretaker-coach Owen da Gama on Thursday but he believes he still has something to offer the side. I believe that I can still offer something to the national team any given opportunity to represent my country I will jump at it without thinking twice about it " he said this week."I love representing my country it is always a good challenge to put my body on the line for my country."There are not many people out there who will say that they had the opportunity even once to wear the national jersey and sing the national anthem in front of thousands of people in a stadium and millions watching on television he said.In the coming months Bafana will be involved in the 2018 World Cup and 2019 African Nations Cup qualifiers and Letsholonyane said he would be honoured to help the country achieve that mission. It would be great to be part of the team that helps the country to qualify for the World Cup. It has not been the case (to qualify for tournaments) in a while and Bafana still have a chance of doing it."I would be honoured (if I were) to be part of that team he said.United have been consistent this season in the league and they are among title favourites together with Cape Town City Bidvest Wits Kaizer Chiefs and Mamelodi Sundowns.Letsholonyane believes that Matsatsantsa can go all the way and lift the Absa Premiership title. I think we can go all the way and win the league we have the players who can compete against anyone I know it is a clich but we will take each game as it comes."We also have a bunch of younger and talented players in the squad who are continuing to learn everyday and have impressed whenever the coach gives them a chance to prove themselves he said. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
