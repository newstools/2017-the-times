Officers were on patrol along Sir Lowry s Pass outside of Cape Town when they spotted a white Toyota Corolla parked on the side of the road.Upon investigating they found a man 71 and a woman in a compromising position in the parked vehicle last Thursday. They requested the duo to get dressed and asked the man to get out of the vehicle so they could speak to him. He refused and sped off instead nearly running over the two officers the City of Cape Town said in a statement on Monday.Police joined the chase and the driver was finally stopped and arrested on the N2.He was detained at the Somerset West Police Station on charges of attempted murder failing to comply with a lawful instruction reckless and negligent driving and resisting arrest after being caught committing an indecent act. This is yet another example of the consequences of bolting but it seems few people learn their lesson said the City s Mayoral Committee Member for Safety and Security Alderman JP Smith. In the event that you are caught in the wrong just abide by the instructions of the enforcement agencies. One charge is better than a handful as this latest case proves. - TMG Digital
