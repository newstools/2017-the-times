The match follows a 2-2 draw for Stellenbosch at home to Baroka FC in Wednesday s opening encounter of the six-match mini tournament which will see the winner play in the top-flight next season. If we are going to win promotion we can t draw draw draw because it s missed opportunities said Stellenbosch coach Sammy Troughton whose side left on Thursday for Polokwane and who drive up to Venda on Friday. We ve lost a bit of ground with a point at home and I can t say we deserve much more than a point. We ll be looking to get something out of a our trip and a point wouldn t be bad at Leopards when you consider the type of team they are and the travel there. They are not going to be easy it s a tough place to go but that s the mission. Stellenbosch produced away success over Leopards in the regular National First Division season although they finished one point behind them in the final standings. We had a thriller against them away in the league and won there and I don t think sitting back against them and defending is the way to go Troughton said. That s what gives them momentum. We are going to have to put pressure on. Maybe we need one of two new faces and we have got to have a better performance than the one against Baroka. Troughton was critical of how the home side played in Wednesday s game at the Athlone Stadium. We weren t able to pass the ball five metres and we gave it away countless times too cheaply. We never got into a rhythm. The game was stop-start. I thought we were a little bit unlucky with their second goals which was from a free kick I m not so sure about. But we have to also take some positives out of the game. The goals were well-taken. We can t hammer hammer and be negative. We have to lift these players. To lose would have been a disaster so we did show a little bit of character in coming back twice. That gives us something to work on the Stellenbosch coach added.- TMG Digital/TMG Sport
