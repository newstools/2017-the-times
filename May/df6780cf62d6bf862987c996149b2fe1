Mr Molefe left Eskom under a cloud following the release of the Public Protector's report into State Capture late last year said the party.ANN7 then appeared to discredit Kodwa suggesting that his statement was not authorised . Kodwa s statement on Molefe rejected by ANC officials: ANN7 sources said their video headline.Kodwa s response was retweeted more than 800 times and spawned a barrage of memes.ANN7 appears to have subsequently deleted a tweet promoting the story. This video is unavailable is all the broadcaster s site said on Wednesday.It s not the first time Kodwa and the television channel have bumped heads. Earlier this month he released a statement in reaction to a story citing a source who claimed that President Jacob Zuma was "pushed" to attend Cosatu s May Day rally where he was booed.Such reporting he said was "habitual and typical of ANN7 - devoid of truth divisive and designed to create an illusion of some ANC insider status for the channel".
