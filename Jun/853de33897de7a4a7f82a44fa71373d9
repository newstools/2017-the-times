Painstil 35 joined Amakhosi in July last year and his departure will be seen by many as a move to bring on board an assistant with a lot more experience coaching in the top flight.The former West Ham United and Leicester City star defender Painstil played under Komphela at Maritzburg United two years ago before the former Bafana Bafana mentor recruited him to be his second in command at Naturena. Kaizer Chiefs and John Paintsil have come to an agreement to terminate his contract as the assistant coach of the Club with effect from 6 June 2017 said Chiefs in a short statement. His contract was due to expire in June 2018. Both parties have signed a separation agreement the terms of which are confidential. The Club thanks John for his contribution and wish him well for his future endeavours.Chiefs finished fourth while having to endure early Cup competition exits at the hands of Cape Town City (MTN8 quarterfinals) Free State Stars (Telkom Knockout Cup quarterfinals) and SuperSport United (Nedbank Cup quarterfinals). - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
