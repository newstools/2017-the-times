You can't blame [a pastor] on the teachings of the Bible."However, Motsoeneng said churches should not impose, fight or condemn homosexuality."I accept anyone, whether gay or lesbian. God loves us all, whether we are right or wrong. He wants all people to repent and come to him."The truth is: God made a male and a female, but something went wrong along the line. It is our duty to pray about it. They are harmless and most of them are kind people. It is a sin against themselves and God. I see them as people who deserve love and support. I am against people who harm and kill them," he said.He aired his view as controversy broke out over visiting cleric from Ghana, Dag Heward-Mills, who criticised homosexuals at the Grace Bible Church at the weekend.Idols SA judges Somizi Mhlongo walked out of the service after the comments were made during a Sunday service.This article first appeared in Sowetan.
