The Frenchman has been serving as a flight engineer for Expeditions 50 and 51 since November 2016, and is due to return to Earth on 2 June.According to Space.com Pesquet is on the station with commander Peggy Whitson, Russian cosmonaut Oleg Notisky. Last month they were joined by Nasa astronaut Jack Fischer and Russian cosmonaut Fyodor Yurchikhin.Earlier this month Pesquet released another video, which showed sunrise over auroras on the earth - saying "The first bright rise is not the sun!" The first bright light is in fact the moon, followed by Venus. The sunrise only comes at the end of the video.A timelapse of aurora into a sunrise.
