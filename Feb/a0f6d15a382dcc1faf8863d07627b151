As government we have an inescapable responsibility to protect our animals whether it s rhinos against poaching and donkeys against their skin hunt by people who are so intent to enrich themselves through illegal and cruel means he said.Mthembu said he had directed his office to show a keen interest in the case by working with all interested players for the welfare of animals in the province. The department will put measures in place to protect our animals from any form of poaching by forming partnerships with the communities that owned these animals said Mthembu. TMG Digital/TimesLIVE
