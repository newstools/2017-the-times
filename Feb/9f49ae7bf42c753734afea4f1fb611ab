Only strong action by the league can help reverse that.Of course, pitch invasions occur in all sports around the world. But they are too common in football and people have been hurt.It was notable that Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane commented that the last time he had to sprint for the safety of the change rooms was in Algeria in June when the fans of ES Setif invaded the field during a Champions' League game.A policeman accidentally shot and killed a Kaizer Chiefs supporter as fans invaded the pitch after Chiefs' 2-0 victory against Chippa United at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium, in Port Elizabeth, in May 2015.That tragedy should have set alarm bells ringing about the dangers of pitch invasions, even when they are part of a celebration..The PSL's security officials at Loftus on Saturday appeared to be too few and perhaps not sufficiently well-trained to cope with events during Sundowns' 6-0 thrashing of Pirates.It is believed that 13 people were treated for injuries from the pitch invasion by Bucs' supporters, which prompted Sundowns fans to also stream onto the field, leading to ugly fighting and violence.A police armoured vehicle going onto the field, and teargas and stun grenades being fired to disperse the crowd, is not the image the multibillion-rand PSL wants to portray during its matches.Saturday's scenes affect the image of a league struggling to fill stadiums.Football supporters' lives should not be at risk.The nightmare of the 43 lives lost in the 2001 Ellis Park disaster must never be revisited.There should be a full investigation into the events at Loftus on Saturday .
