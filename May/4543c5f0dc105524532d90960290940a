The article ignited furious debate on social media and on our letters page, including accusations that The Times was fuelling racial hatred and misrepresenting the story. But instead of shooting the messenger, South Africans should rather reflect and participate in a broader debate about why an apparently peaceful town managed to transform itself into a battle zone in a matter of days.This is not only about Coligny. It is bigger than that. Coligny has become a microcosm of the situation in many small South African towns. For too long racism has remained the norm in pockets of our society. Coligny resident Tebogo Matshila told The Times: "We don't even take notice of these things any more because it is normal to us." White resident Isabel Fourie, who has lived there for 50 years, said she believed black and white were living peacefully together: "Maybe older white people are racist - but they still greet black people." Her ignorance, and Matshila's pent-up frustrations, tell a hair-raising story, illustrating how far the two communities really are from understanding one another.Clearly racial tensions have been simmering in Coligny for many years and Mosweu's death was the trigger for residents to take to the streets. Crime-ridden action can never be condoned but what has happened in Coligny should be a lesson for us all.Stop for a moment, think about what happened and why, write about it, talk about it. At least try and cross the great divide. Or your town may be next.
