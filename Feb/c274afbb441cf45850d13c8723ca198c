Posting a picture of himself as a young boy with his father, J said that his dad was in the food and beverage business and he hoped he was making his dad proud."I know you looking down over me with a big fat smile! Never felt so close to you as I do right now ... thank you for this. Thank you for what you making happen in my life! I hope I'm making you proud!"He added that he is dedicating his new venture to his father. 'This is my father and I. A phenomenal Food &amp; Beverage manager for majority of his life and worked his butt off making sure we had what we needed at home! Love you Pai! I dedicated #SomethingsCookingByJ to you!' *Tears up.
