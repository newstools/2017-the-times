A woman who was severely burnt in an acid attack on Christmas Eve in Johannesburg is facing a long road to recovery. Tracy Samuels‚ 39‚ was drenched with acid - a raw form of acetone used to clean surfaces – and set on fire in the horrific attack. “She is on the road to recovery‚” said her uncle‚ Leonard Scott-Turner‚ on Friday. He added that her condition remained unchanged. She was admitted to Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto for treatment. A man‚ who was subsequently arrested‚ allegedly attacked her during an argument over a person with whom she had been chatting on social media. Scott-Turner said he expected the recovery process to take between two and three months. Police spokesperson Captain Walter Spencer said a 43-year-old man appeared in the Roodepoort Magistrate’s Court on Thursday. He was released after the case was not put on the court roll and was sent back for further investigation. A future court date will be set once the further investigation is complete and the docket is returned to the court. The police are investigating a case of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm (GBH). The charge can be changed at a later stage. - Additional reporting by Kyle Cowan
