But we were quickly evicted from the Inanda property by several soldiers stationed at the homestead.They cited that it was a difficult time for the family as their reason for ejecting journalists.The soldier is still on the run. His crimes were allegedly triggered by his belief that his girlfriend had been cheating on him.Military police vehicles were seen patrolling the streets in the hilltop neighbourhood where the infantryman spent his childhood.In the wake of her sister s slaying the soldier s girlfriend and her family have gone into hiding fearing that he may come back to finish the job.Another family member was also wounded in the hail of automatic gunfire and the soldier later shot a police officer who was trying to arrest him.Still in his army fatigues and body armour and armed with his military-issue weapon the soldier disappeared.Police spokesperson Brigadier Jay Naicker said that the search for the gunman continued in earnest. He is being sought by police officers and the SANDF jointly. We understand that he is on foot after crashing his car so he cannot run forever Naicker said. It is known that he is from that area so it has become a focal point of the search for him he added.SANDF spokesperson Mafi Mgobozi confirmed the soldier was still on the run. We are confident that we will apprehend him very soon. We have leads we will hopefully get him soon he said.TMG Digital/TimesLIVE
