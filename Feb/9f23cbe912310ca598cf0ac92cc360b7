Criminal charges could also be laid against EnviroServ the operator of the landfill.In a statement released by the environmental affairs department yesterday it was revealed that the a notice of intention to suspect or revoke the company s licence for the site had been issued. The statement was sent out via the eThekwini Municipality s mailing list. The notice is prompted by the findings of a series of investigations by the Green Scorpions in collaboration with the eThekwini Municipality during January 2017 following a significant increase in receipt of malodour and health related complaints linked to the operations of the Shongweni Landfill Site the statement said.EnviroServ has been given until the end of next week to respond as to why the licences shouldn t be suspended or revoked.Residents of the area have long complained about the smell coming from the site and said that it was leading to health problems. Sore scratchy throats and burning eyes were among the most common complaints. The complaints started last year but have become more frequent in recent months.A protest march was scheduled for Saturday coincidentally the day after the statement was released. Despite many interventions implemented by EnviroServ to comply with the instructions contained in the Compliance Notice there is still an unacceptably high level of landfill gases being emitted from the Shongweni landfill site which the authorities have confirmed to be the cause of many of the communities complaints the statement said.It continued that the Green Scorpions the department s environmental investigative unit had been probing the landfill after a search and seizure warrant was executed in September. It was found during the search that EnviroServ Waste Management (Pty) Ltd had failed to comply with the provisions of environmental law and certain conditions of the waste management licence which was issued in terms of the National Environmental Management Waste Act 2008. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) is currently in the process of reviewing the docket and will thereafter make a decision on whether or not (and which parties) to prosecute the statement said.The exact nature of the contraventions were not outlined.Questions have been sent to EnviroServ over the allegations against them and the company was formulating a response. This is a developing story and will be updated.
