The Brazilians coach spoke with a sombre tone with his hand on his cheek unable to hide his disappointment.There was also anger especially after clashing with the security personnel that was in his face after the loss.Chiefs' coach Steve Komphela moved quickly to quell that tension apologising on behalf of the club.Jingles took a philosophical stance as his side continues to drop points. I don t think that this loss is our last chance of winning the title Mosimane said. Remember when we lost to Ajax (Cape Town) last year?"People wrote that we are under pressure and we might not win the league. We fought our way back. There is still a long way to go."We should wait and see. I can t just give up. It has to come to normality first (everyone on the same number of games)."The truth of the matter though is that we haven t won our last four games and we are dropping points. This will test our character. Sundowns have picked up just two points from a possible 12 in their last four games.They lost to Chiefs and Cape Town City and were held to goalless draws by Chippa United and Polokwane City.The points they dropped there would have made their catch-up programme a bit easier because things will only get hectic for them from now on.There is the Nedbank Cup to come this week and the CAF Champions League group stage starting next month.The Tshwane side can t afford any more slip-ups if they are to retain the league title they won in record fashion last year.It s still mainly in their hands as they are seven points behind log leaders Bidvest Wits with two games in hand. We are struggling a little bit Mosimane said. We are not in a very good position. I told the guys that this will test their character."We will see how they react to that. At least we are progressing in the Nedbank Cup and the Champions League. We need to go to the wire (in the league)."We will see how it goes. We just have to go all out. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
