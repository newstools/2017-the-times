The league will sit up and take notice should African champions Sundowns having recovered from a five-match winless slump with four straight victories make it win number five in KwaMashu just north of Durban.Also on Friday night Bidvest Wits might be kicking themselves at having let slip a chance to take the PSL lead when they meet Highlands Park at Makhulong Stadium.Wits were beaten 1-0 at home by SuperSport United at Bidvest Stadium on Tuesday night where Buhle Mkhwanazi s defensive error led to Thuso Phala s winner in a game where the Clever Boys were pressing for a victory.Wits (on 45 points from 23 games) can at best go to second place should Sundowns lose and will remain in third if the Brazilians win.Downs can go to 50 points from 24 games if they beat Arrows which would be a point more than current PSL leaders Cape Town City (49) who have played a match more on 25.City do not play again until Monday when they meet Maritzburg United at Harry Gwala Stadium.Wits and Sundowns also square off on Monday in arguably the game of the season at Bidvest Stadium.While Sundowns have an overall dominant record against Arrows coach Pitso Mosimane has admitted that the KwaZulu-Natal side have been hard to beat for his team since Abafana Bes thende s promotion back to the PSL last season.Downs have won once in four meetings against Arrows since their return from the NFD 3-0 at home in the league this season in November.The Brazilians lost 1-0 against Arrows in the Nedbank Cup last-16 just under three weeks ago.In last season s league games against Arrows Downs lost away and could only draw at home.Sundowns taking possession of top of the log would send a warning to the PSL that the Brazilians who have played catch-up in fixtures and points since winning the 2016 Caf Champions League are on what might be an unstoppable warpath to defend their title.Friday (both 8pm):Lamontville Golden Arrows vs Mamelodi Sundowns (Prince Magogo Stadium) Highlands Park vs Bidvest Wits (Makhulong Stadium) - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
