But it was not as impressive as they might have hoped against an energetic semi-professional side with new coach Kjell Jonevret suggesting his Pirates side were still well short of confidence.Pirates last won in November when they were last in Eastern Cape against Chippa United and will be hoping now that they have turned the corner but Jonevret said there was still much work ahead.Pirates led 1-0 at half-time through Dove Wome, extending the lead with a wondrous free kick from Mpho Makola early in the second half before EC Bees came right back at them and pulled one back through Bongani Chikila.But Thamsanqa Gabuza made sure of the result with a 66th- minute tap-in after Bees had run out of sting.The semi-pro side from the ABC Motsepe League had given Pirates an awkward welcome on a rare visit to the area.But it did not take long for the Buccaneers to impress.Bees gave Makola too much space on the edge of the penalty area in the 15th minute and he ghosted past two defenders before putting the ball back across goal for Wome to tuck away.It should have been 2-0 almost straight from the kick off as Wome proved an inadvertent provider despite a poor cross for Bernard Morrison. But the Ghana international blasted his shot against the crossbar when it would have been easier just to tap-in.Gabuza had two good chances in the first half to also extend the score but on both he headed wide.It was 2-0 in the 52nd minute when Makola hit his free kick straight over the advancing goalkeeper but within three minutes Bees had scored through Chikila.The home side then had Bucs under pressure until Gabuza tapped in Wome's cross to make sure of Pirates' progress.
