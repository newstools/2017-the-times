Cassper dropped a bunch of confessions in a new track called I Wasn't Ready for You on Friday. The track features on the rapper's third album, Thuto.He started the track by admitting that he had been drowning his sorrows after the break-up and had been thinking a lot about what had gone wrong with the couple's relationship."I started giving the side b*tchs your side of the bed. That sh*t was so disrespectful and I don't have an excuse. I look at myself in the mirror like,' Dawg, what happened to you? You told this woman you loved her and then you promised her joy. She needed a man and you acted like a boy. Manipulated her mind. I got you confused. It's time I admit I wasn't ready for you," he rapped.He went on to wish Boity well in her new romance."I always hear about you. They tell me you're doing well. They say you have a new house. They say you have a new man. I hope that he is a good man. I hope he is nothing like me. I hope he won't have to suffer for my incompetency. I hope that you learn to trust him despite the things that I did. I know you saw through all the excuses and lying," he added.Announcing their break-up in an interview with True Love last year, Boity said that their split was amicable. She says their issue was time management and they were 'too busy for each other.'"Not once did I ever feel like he has cheated on me or giving someone else attention. There was never a time we fought about any girl, he was absolutely respectful towards me in terms of his female fans. Funny enough the female fans just showed me so much respect as well," she said.
