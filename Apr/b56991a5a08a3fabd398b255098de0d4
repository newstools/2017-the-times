The moment when Pravin Gordhan, finance minister at the time, received a standing ovation at Kathrada's funeral will be written into history books.Video clips went viral of the executive director of the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation, Neeshan Balton, telling an emotional Gordhan: "Irrespective of whether you are a minister or not in days or weeks to come, you remain true to the values and principles that Ahmed Kathrada would be proud of."At this same event, former president Kgalema Motlanthe read out the letter Kathrada had written to President Jacob Zuma, asking him to step down. Anti-Zuma groups brimmed with hope. Key people spoke out. Political change became a possibility.That was almost two weeks ago. How much has changed since then.Last weekend a civil society organisation, the Durban-based Active Citizens Movement, was forced to turn to court to prevent its Kathrada memorial service from falling to pieces. It failed in its bid to prevent the ANC Youth League from attending, although the court interdicted the league from disrupting proceedings.The rest, unfortunately, is for the history books again. The ANCYL pounced on Gordhan and ANC treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize the moment they took to the podium. Gordhan barely got a chance to speak. Whenever other speakers mentioned his name, the ANCYL booed them.It's interesting how Gordhan, Mkhize and ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe were told by the ANC to toe the line after speaking out publicly against the sacking of the finance minister and his deputy, Mcebisi Jonas. It's interesting how senior ANC members said the organisation needed to show a united front, and sort their problems out "the ANC way".But when Zuma's lapdogs disrupted the memorial service of a highly respected ANC cadre, there seemed to be no consequences. In fact, it seemed staged. The ANC demands a united front, but only when it suits Zuma's agenda. That is the new ANC way.
