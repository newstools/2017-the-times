His victims include Macbute Sinyabi and most recently Sydney Maluleka.Fuzile lives with his parents and older sister in an area he describes as dangerous. I don t go out at night because it s dangerous. I don t have friends from where I live because they are gangsters and using drugs. My friends are from the gym.
