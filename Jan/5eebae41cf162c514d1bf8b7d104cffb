This is according to businessman Lloyd Ngavu the man behind the first annual SAPAs taking place in Cape Town on February 8. Ngavu said he got the idea for the awards after noticing the pageantry at the annual openings of Parliament and the State of the Nation Address each year. I started with the concept from 2014 after the national elections. I managed to meet a few people who were interested in supporting [the concept]. It s a huge event so it needed financial backing he told The Times on Tuesday.With everything in place and the 250-seat event already sold out Ngavu hopes that the awards will be a carrot dangled in front of politicians to force them to do better.EFF leader Julius Malema earlier on Tuesday said that he and his party had turned down nomination saying that the awards were nothing more than personal glorification . We told them we cannot be involved in this. Politicians must not be awarded for doing their jobs he said.But Ngavu would not weigh in on this. That is their own opinion he said.Instead he defended the SAPAs saying that handing out awards was done in much the same way that companies would reward employees who went beyond the call of duty. Irrespective of what is happening in parliament there are those members who are going the extra mile to help communities live a better live. This must be an inspiration to lazy MPs. [It s a message] that communities won t recognise you if you re not giving them service delivery said Ngavu.Full list of nominees (as provided by event organisers):Best Parliamentarian of the Year:John Steenhuisen Bantu Holomisa Terror Lekota Buti Manamela Debater of the Year Nqabayomzi Nkwakhwa Mkhuleko Hlengwa Phumzile Van DammeCommittee MP of the Year Gwede Mantashe James Selfe Naledi Pandor Phumzile Van Damme.Women in Politics AwardsLindiwe Zulu Stella Ndabeni Abrahams Sisi Ntombela Phumzile Van Damme Veronica Van Dyk Magdelene Moonsamy Hellen zilleE-Politician of the Year AwardFikile Mbalula Mmusi Maimane Lindiwe Zulu Afzul RehmanPublic Campaigner of the YearMzwandile Masina Paul Mashatile David Makhura Gwede Mantashe Mmusi Maimane Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi Nomvula Mokonyane Best Executive Mayor of the Year Mzwandile Masina Solly Msimanga Zandile Gumede Patricia De Lille Thabo Manyoni Parks TauLifetime Politician Icon Achievement Award (honorary award)Winnie Madikizela-MandelaBest Political Party of the YearDEMOCRATIC ALLIANCE AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS INDEPENDENT FREEDOM PARTY UNITED DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT AFRICAN INDEPENDENT CONGRESS AFRICAN CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTYSouth African Politician of the YearMmusi Maimane Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi Bantu Holomisa Mlibo Qoboshiayane Jacob Zuma Young Leader AwardNjabulo Nzuza (ANCYL) Phumzile van Damme (DA) Mkhuleko Hlengwa (IFP) Yongama Zigebe(UDM) Mduduzi Manana (ANC) Reggie Nkabinde (ANCYL) Political Analyst of the Year Award Somadoda Fikeni Mcebisi Ndletyana Aubrey Matshiqi Steven FriedmanBest Dressed Male Political FigureFikile Mbalula Mduduzi Manana Malusi Gigaba Mlibo Qoboshiyane Jeff RadebeBest Dressed Female Political FigureStella Ndabeni Abrahams Lindiwe Zulu Lindiwe Sisulu Thandi Modise Nomvula Mokonyane Best Premier of the Year Awards Gauteng: David Makhura Eastern Cape: Phumulo Masualle Limpopo: Stanley Mathabatha Free State: Ace Magashule Western Cape: Hellen Zille Mpumalanga: David MabuzaBest Minister of the Year AwardMinister of Home Affairs - Mr Malusi GigabaMinister of Water and Sanitation - Ms Nomvula Mokonyane Minister of Public Works - Mr Thulas Nxesi Minister of Sport and Recreation - Mr Fikile Mbalula Minister in the Presidency - Mr Jeff Radebe Deputy Minister of Communications - Ms Stella Ndabeni-AbrahamsCitizen s Choice of the Year AwardFikile Mbalula Malusi Gigaba Ace Magashule Mcebisi Jonas Nqabayomzi Nkwakwa Gwede Mantashe Supra Mahumapelo Hlaudi Motsoeneng Jacob Zuma Pravin Gordhan Nhlanhla Nene Reggie NkabindeTMG Digital/The Times
