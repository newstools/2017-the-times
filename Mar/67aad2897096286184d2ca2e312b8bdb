A 52nd minute penalty, struck firmly by left back Phinease Ravhuhali, opened the scoring and Richard Matloga hammered home a second in the 73rd minute to mark the first win for the struggling Limpopo side since they beat Platinum Stars in the Telkom Knockout in October.Baroka were awarded a second spot kick 10 minutes after their first when Matloga was brought down for a second time but Ravhuhali hit an exact replica of his first effort and had it saved by Buti KhozaRavhuhali also struck in the inside of the goal post midway through the first half with an attempted cross that floated over the home goalkeeper and came inches from breaking the deadlock.In the closing stages a breakaway presented Mxolisi Kunene with a chance to make it 3-0 but with just Khoza to beat he took too long and the keeper got a hand to the ball to foil him.Both teams struggled on a bone dry pitch with very little grass and with a decent strength wind.Baroka were playing for the first time under a new coaching arrangement where Kgoloko Thobejane now shares head coaching duties with Milton Dlamini, but still showed little evidence of structure or any particular game plan to defeat a side who actually beat them away in the National First Division last season.But they look physically stronger, despite resting some key players ahead of next Saturday s home game against Kaizer Chiefs, and in the end merited their success.The Nedbank Cup was the launch pad for the club six years ago when they were still a third tier side and went all the way to the semifinals. Saturday s rare taste of success, combined with the memories of their upset win over Chiefs in 2011, might come in handy for a crucial league encounter next.Other Nedbank Cup results:Jomo Cosmos 3 - 0 United Rovers : Tsakane Stadium Buya Msuthu 0 - 2 Bloemfontein Celtic : Moruleng Stadium - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
