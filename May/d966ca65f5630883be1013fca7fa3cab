That has prompted AutoTrader South Africa s largest online vehicle platform to come up with Marketplace combining the convenience of clicks with the security of bricks .The bricks part of the service is provided by Bosch s 165 service stations around the country.Sellers are vetted before being introduced to a potential buyer then they meet at a Bosch outlet of their choice where the seller s car is technically inspected; a deal manager helps the two parties negotiate a fair price and finance is arranged via AutoTrader s finance partners.The solution seeks to address the risks for both buyer and seller.With many of the cars posted on online sites being stolen or cloned or mechanically unsound - or both - and private sales not being covered by the Consumer Protection Act the buyer runs the risk of landing up with a voetstoets lemon or a stolen car that they will have to forfeit if recovered.The seller s risk is even bigger said AutoTrader CEO George Mienie. We ve seen a declining appetite on the part of consumers to advertise their cars for sale online privately even when we offer free adverts as a special. They re scared not just of being defrauded but of losing their lives. The company had been looking for a solution for the past seven or eight years Mienie said. The biggest challenge was finding the right partner and we believe we ve achieved that with Bosch given that it s a trusted recognised brand with a national footprint and the capacity to provide the service. The service couldn t guarantee to eliminate the criminal risk Mienie said but we are certainly mitigating it".The company is expecting 1 600 to 1 800 deals a month to be done via its Marketplace.There are costs of course.For the seller a once-off inspection fee of R1 249 to have their car listed on AutoTrader.co.za . Buying a car from Marketplace costs R3 899 for the facilitation and administration and R1 649 for registration. The total cost can be included in the buyer s financed amount or paid upfront. This is a great example of collaboration among parties to assist in the fight against fraud and in line with SA Fraud Prevention Services (SAFPS) objective in providing a platform to collaborate against fraud said SAFPS executive director Manie van Schalkwyk.-TMG Digital/TimesLIVE
