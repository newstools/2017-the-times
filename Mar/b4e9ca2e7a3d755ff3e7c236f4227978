The incident was thrust into the spotlight again this week when a tweet by City Press made reference to his conviction in an article about his artwork collaboration with rapper AKA. The tweet caused fierce debate and saw AKA come out in defence of Okmalumkoolkat.The Gqi rapper was largely silent on the fiasco, only telling the media to focus on his music instead, but finally broke his silence on the matter on Wednesday morning.In a series of tweets he apologised to the woman who felt violated by him and to the nation as a whole.I AM SINCERELY SORRY THAT A WOMAN FELT VIOLATED ON MY ACCOUNT.
