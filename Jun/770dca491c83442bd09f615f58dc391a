 We are quite happy that Phahlane has left; whether he has stepped down or was removed or whatever it is said Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union (Popcru) spokesperson Richard Mamabolo.President Jacob Zuma appointed Mothiba to the position on Wednesday stating that Lieutenant-General Kgomotso Phahlane s term had come to an end on June 1.Zuma thanked Phahlane for his leadership of the police during his acting tenure.Lt-General Mothiba was until now the SAPS Divisional Head of the Management Intervention Unit."President Zuma has congratulated the new Acting Commissioner and wishes him all the success in his new responsibility " a brief statement from his office said.Mamabolo said Popcru had placed all hope in Mothiba restoring the integrity of the office of the police commissioner adding that the union had felt that the SA Police Service had been compromised under Phahlane s leadership.He however said he had his doubts that Mothiba would have sufficient time to prove his capabilities in his projected short term in the top cop seat. Considering the time that is available we are not sure that he will be able to do a lot said Mamabolo. Riah Phiyega is still the National Police Commissioner and her term comes to an end at the end of June therefore a new police commissioner will need to be appointed said Mamabolo.Phiyega was suspended following an inquiry into the Marikana 2012 tragedy where police opened fire on striking Lonmin mineworkers killing 34 of them.Mamabolo could not comment on whether Popcru would fully throw its weight behind Mothiba taking over the position from Phiyega. We cannot make those pronouncements as it is the President s prerogative to decide who fills the position Mamabolo added.Mothiba previously served as the Gauteng Police Commissioner between June 2014 and January 2016.One of the decisions he made during his tenure was to suspend the oversight functions of the community policing forum a decision which drew mass criticism from the Gauteng Department of Community Safety.In 2014 he expressed his concerns at the police being seen as a public menace.In an interview with Radio 702 Mothiba said: In the long term the people are seeing the police in front of them and may think the police are the enemy. And the situation might build up where the police become the enemy."
