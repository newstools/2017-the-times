The 28-year-old joined Pirates in 2010 but scored just two goals in 18 months at the club and had a further barren six months with Platinum Stars before heading back to Malawi. We have been very thin in the striking department this season with only the youngster Sibusiso Sibeko and then the more experienced Lerato Lamola and Mauricio Barrios " said Arrows coach Clinton Larsen. As you know Barrios has terminated his contract with the club so we need to bring in another one. Msowoya has scored lots of goals back in Malawi and has had a couple of really good seasons where he was top-scorer so we are having a look at him. Despite their struggles up front Golden Arrows had a good first half of the season and are currently sixth in the table.They resume their Absa Premiership campaign away at SuperSport United on February 8. - TMG Digital
