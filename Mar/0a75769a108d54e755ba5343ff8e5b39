Times Media Digital brings you the lowdown on their opponents.AFRICAN CHAMPIONS LEAGUE MAMELODI SUNDOWNS VS KCCAThe Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) were previously known as Kampala City Council before the re-branding of the Ugandan capital s service delivery operation.The club was actually formed in 1963 by Samuel Wamala who was head of the council's Sewage Works and within five years had been promoted to the top-flight in Uganda.They have won 11 Ugandan Super League titles including three of the last four years but have never made it to the group stages of either of the African club competitions.They did make it to the semifinals of the now defunct CAF Cup in 1997 though and have had success against South African opposition before.In 2009 they knocked SuperSport United out of the Champions League in the first round winning 2-1 away and then claiming a 1-1 draw in South Africa.They also met Ajax Cape Town in the 2001 CAF Cup but lost 3-1 on aggregate.Defender Joseph Ochaya was part of the Uganda side that recently competed at the African Nations Cup finals in Gabon while star striker Geoffrey Sserunkuma was formerly on the books of Bloemfontein Celtic Vasco da Gama and Bidvest Wits.KCCA reached this stage of the competition after beating Angolan side Primeiro de Agosto on the away goals rule. The won 1-0 at home in the first leg and lost 2-1 away. Sserunkuma scored both their goals. BIDVEST WITS VS AL AHLYEgyptian giants Al Ahly need no introduction to South African fans and are often the yard-stick used to test teams from the country on the continent.The Cairo club are the most successful club side ever in African competition with a record eight Champions League titles (last in 2013) to go with a record four wins in the now defunct African Cup Winners Cup and victory in the African Confederation Cup (2014).That is along with 38 Egyptian League titles and 35 wins in the Egyptian Cup proving this is a club used to success.Until recently they had been the scourge of South African sides but there has been some success against the Red Devils in the last few years.Platinum Stars were unlikely winners over the Egyptians in the 2008 Champions League though they lost on aggregate while Orlando Pirates beat them in the semifinals of the Confederation Cup in 2013.In all South African teams have a respectable record against Ahly with five wins six defeats and five draws in their 16 previous meetings though they have been outscored 21-15.Despite their dominance of the African game Ahly have in fact never won a game in South Africa.They had six players in the Egypt squad that competed at the Nations Cup in Gabon including Ahmed Fathy midfielder Abdallah Said and striker Marwan Mohsen.The side is coached by former Egypt international Hossam El-Badry and the team received a bye into this stage of the competition. AFRICAN CONFEDERATION CUP SUPERSPORT UNITED VS AL-AHLY SHENDISuperSport have a tricky tie in the first round of the Confederation Cup against Sudanese side Al-Ahly Shendi in the north of the country on the banks of the Nile river some 150-kilometres north of Khartoum.The 74-year-old club has never managed to finish higher than third in their domestic league which they have managed on five occasions (last in 2016) not surprising perhaps given the utter dominance of Al-Hilal and Al-Merreikh in the Sudanese game.Shendi received a bye into this stage of the competition and have made a mediocre start to the Sudanese championship this season with just a single win in their first seven matches to hover just above the relegation zone.The only previous time SuperSport have faced Sudanese opposition was in the Champions League in 2004 when they ousted Al-Hilal 2-0 on aggregate.No South African side has ever won a game in Sudan in five attempts. PLATINUM STARS VS VIPERSThe 2015 Ugandan Premier League champions Vipers are from Wakiso Town around 20-kilometres outside of Kampala.They won through to this round by edging Comoros side Volcan FC on the away goals rule after a 1-1 aggregate score.Kaizer Chiefs thumped Volcan 4-0 in last year s Champions League with the islanders then failing to show up for the return match.Vipers gained entry into the Confederation Cup after winning the 2016 Ugandan Cup with the side currently third in the 2016/17 Uganda Premier League season but some nine points behind leaders KCCA having played a game more.Defender Nicholas Wadada was part of the Uganda side that recently competed at the African Nations Cup finals in Gabon.Vipers have never played against South African opposition before. They were originally founded as Bunamwaya FC in 1969 but changed their name to Vipers in 2012. - TMG Digital
