Instead, Allegri said on Monday, he would throw on all his best attacking players in an attempt to outscore his opponents in the first leg at the Juventus stadium."It's impossible to think about playing two 0-0 draws and winning on penalties," Allegri told reporters."All the four or five attacking players will play, I don't see any reason why we should have to do without them."It's a great challenge and we have to play with the confidence that we can beat Barcelona."Allegri did not name his team but his comments suggest that Croatia forward Mario Mandzukic and Colombia winger Juan Cuadrado will both play in addition to the attacking pair of Gonzalo Higuain and Paulo Dybala."It's always good not to concede a goal when you play the first leg at home but that is going to be difficult this time and it is likely they will score," admitted Allegri, even though his side have conceded only two goals in the competition."Barcelona have those three in attack but they also leave space behind," he said referring to Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar. "You have to play on their weaknesses."We've changed a lot in recent years, we've grown in self-confidence and awareness in the Champions League."Juventus should be used to playing games like this. Juventus have important qualities and we need to show them on the pitch, while knowing the difficulties we'll face against a great team."
