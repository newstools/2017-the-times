But this week her third attempt was stalled because of high winds near the summit."She's fitter than she's ever been. Mentally and physically she's very fit, so we believe she'll be able to do it this year if the weather permits," said close friend Sarieta Schultz, who is also responsible for updating Khumalo's social media accounts during the summit attempt.Khumalo is hoping it will be third time lucky for her, after her attempt in 2014 was abandoned when an avalanche killed 16 sherpa. Her attempt in 2015 was abandoned following a massive earthquake in Nepal.Schultz said Khumalo had a bad accident last year when she crashed while cycling, fell into a coma and had to be airlifted to safety. But her recovery was quick and she was back in gym just weeks later, with her sights firmly set on reaching the summit of Everest."My dream is to go higher and go further for as long as I breathe."To pave the way for my children and other ordinary people, so we may realise and accept that ordinary people like us can achieve extraordinary things."To not think too much about the difficulties on the way but keep focused on the end goal and to take their hand, motivate them to realise that they, too, may dream the impossible dream," she wrote on her website.On Tuesday, however, the Zambia-born mother of two's Facebook page said she had to turn back from her attempt on the summit of the mountain.Despite this drawback, she was still feeling "strong and determined", said the post.Yesterday her camp said her group was in the process of returning to camp two because of the windy conditions."It is not yet clear if, or when, they will be able to make another attempt to reach the summit.Four found dead in tent probably suffocatedNepali sherpas have found four climbers dead in their tents on Mount Everest, officials said yesterday . It is thought they died of carbon monoxide poisoning.Ten people have died on the mountain in the past month.The four climbers were found in two tents at Camp Four, at 8 000m, overnight, Mingma Sherpa, of the Seven Summit Treks group, said in Kathmandu.It was not clear how they died and their identities had not been established.The Himalayan Times reported that two of the dead were foreigners. Rescuers believed they suffocated."It is most likely they died from carbon monoxide poisoning by using stoves in the tent without proper ventilation," US climber Alan Arnette said in a blog post.The sherpas who discovered the bodies were on their way to retrieve the body of Vladimir Strba of Slovakia who died near the summit at the weekend.More than 5000 climbers have scaled Mount Everest since it was first climbed by New Zealander Sir Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay in 1953 and nearly 300 have died trying.Many of the victims remain on the mountain, entombed in snow, as it is too difficult to bring their bodies down.Exhaustion, exposure, frostbite, falls and altitude sickness are major causes of death on Everest.But the biggest killer in recent years has been avalanches.Eighteen people were killed in 2015 when a 7.8 magnitude earthquake triggered avalanches that smashed into the base camp.A year earlier 16 sherpas hauling gear to higher camps for climbers were killed when they were hit by an avalanche while they were crossing the treacherous Khumbu Icefall, just above base camp.Nepal has issued permits to 371 foreign climbers this season, up from last year's 281.The climbing season closes at the end of May. - additional reporting by Reuters
