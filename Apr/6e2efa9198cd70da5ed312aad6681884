Sbu told his fans via a message on Instagram that he had sold a 26% stake of MoFaya to Coca-Cola for a whopping R493-million.Except, obvs it was a joke. Besides Sbu previously admitting that he hasn't made a cent with the energy drink, alarm bells in the form of the amount of cash and the fact that it was 1 April should have alerted fans. It did, but some former friends and even ex-girlfriends fell for the news.He shared a screengrab of a message he received from a former friend saying he owed him cash. He later deleted the post, but not before he took shots at his so-called friends and ex-girlfriends for suddenly appearing out of the dark when there was money involved.#Awks
