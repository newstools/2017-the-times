It was published in the New York Times on March 3 this year but she wrote it over several days ending on Valentine's Day.Her cancer was diagnosed in September."So many plans instantly went poof."No trip with my husband and parents to South Africa. No reason now to apply for the Harvard Loeb Fellowship. No dream tour of Asia with my mother. No writers residencies at those wonderful schools in India Vancouver Jakarta."No wonder the word cancer and cancel look so similar " she wrote in the New York Times.Her husband Jason Brian Rosenthal and she were 24 when they met."By the end of dinner I knew I wanted to marry him."Jason? He knew a year later."She listed his physical appearance as 5-foot-10 tall and weighing 160 pounds and his qualities as a great father to their three adult children as well as being handy around the house a music lover and artist."This is a man who because he is always up early surprises me every Sunday morning by making some kind of oddball smiley face out of items near the coffeepot: a spoon a mug a banana " she wrote describing how she wanted more time with him and their children."But that is not going to happen... I probably have only a few days left being a person on this planet. So why I am doing this?"(I hope) that the right person reads this finds Jason and another love story begins."But her poignant letter equally stated: "I m going to miss looking at that face of his."Read the full letter here.
