Elgar was 76 not out at tea on the first day which South Africa reached on 147/4.That represented a fightback from the 66/3 the home side slumped to after Lankan captain Angelo Mathews put them into bat - perhaps to avoid having to take first strike on a green grassy pitch that lurked under cloudy skies.Stephen Cook became the first victim of the helpful bowling conditions when he edged the fourth ball of the match an out-swinger from Suranga Lakmal to wicketkeeper Kusal Mendis.Elgar and Hashim Amla survived the new ball and were approaching two hours at the crease together when Lahiru Kumara cleanbowled Amla for 29 with an inswinger to end the partnership at 66.Five balls later Kumara had JP Duminy superbly caught by Mendis who hurled himself down the leg side to send South Africa s No. 4 back to the dressingroom without scoring.Faf du Plessis joined Elgar to see out the last two overs of the session and they batted together until 17 balls before tea.Slow left-armer Rangana Herath snuffed out the stand at 76 with a rare turning delivery that took the edge and flew to slip to remove Du Plessis for 38.Four overs earlier Herath had Du Plessis dropped at mid-off by Upul Tharanga at mid-off on 31.Herath took 1/9 from seven overs. - TMG Digital
