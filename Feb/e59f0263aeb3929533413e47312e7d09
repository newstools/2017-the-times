As much as Shona and his wife Connie are household names for their various roles on popular soapies, their skills transcended the acting world and the two became respected producers with the establishment of their company Ferguson Films.Together, they are responsible for hit shows including The Queen, Rockville and Igazi.But it hasn't been an easy journey.Shona took to Twitter to explain the many challenges he has faced. Don't focus on the flash &amp; think it's been an easy ride. In fact it gets harder everyday. Being a BLACK PRODUCER is not easy.You are disrespected and ill treated for doing good, creating jobs &amp; giving people opportunities to do what they love &amp; earn a living...White producers are never disrespected by black folks. It's sad that it's our brothers &amp; sisters who wish you ill because u r doing well...You work hard to contribute to the industry &amp; grow it but it's the very people that you give these opportunities to that spit in your face..We are very grateful. We are not asking for special treatment. All I ask is you give us the same respect you give the white producers...This is a very small industry. Be careful how you treat people &amp; how you behave. When u are out of work tomorrow just know it's all on YOU..Fact is I LOVE it and by the grace of GOD we will always find the strength to continue....I just want to make great tv and films. I have no time for unnecessary crap. I'm going to leave it here....
