Social media is abuzz after a video of an alleged road rage incident surfaced. The video is undated CCTV footage of the incident which happened on London Road in Alexandra‚ Johannesburg‚ after two men were involved in a minor car accident. Social media users tracked down driver of the Porsche who vandalised the Range Rover. Unconfirmed reports on social media said the victim was a pensioner. Lance O’Leary punches and kicks the door of the pensioner’s vehicle repeatedly and shoves a bystander away before continuing to vandalise the car. He then starts punching the side-view mirror before appearing to throw a punch at the driver. The attacker then moves to the back of the car‚ tears off the back windscreen wiper and opens the passenger door. In another video‚ filmed from inside the vehicle‚ the attacker is filmed tapping on the window and saying: “I’m going to find you‚ mother f*ck*r”. According to his LinkedIn page O’Leary is the managing director at Southern African Automotive Supplies in Johannesburg. He said on Tuesday: “I am consulting with my attorney and will release an official statement tomorrow (Friday).”
