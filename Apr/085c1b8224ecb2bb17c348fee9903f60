This after the murders of deputy mayor Thandazile Phoswa on Sunday night and municipal manager S bu Sithole a month ago.Speaking to TMG Digital on Monday from the home of the slain Phoswa mayor Sibusiso Joseph Mchunu said it looked like something is targeting the municipality. We just buried the municipal manager who was my right-hand man and now the deputy mayor. She was a young woman who was very calm said Mchunu.ANC regional chairman Mthandeni Dlungwana said Phoswa s death was a big loss to the municipality and the ANC. She was a committed cadre of the ANC. She joined the party at a young age. Her calibre and expertise earned her the responsibility of deputy mayor. She was dedicated to the cause of the party and the development of society. She worked hard to ensure stability in Richmond. She was a fearless woman said Dlungwana.He said it was devastating that this happened within a month of Sithole s murder. We are still waiting for police to indicate what happened. At this point I don t think her killing had anything to do with politics said Dlungwana.Police spokesman Captain Nqobile Gwala said the circumstances around Phoswa s death were still unknown. The deputy mayor was found at her home in Ndaleni in Richmond with a gunshot wound to the head. She was taken to a clinic where she was declared dead on arrival. We are not sure if it is a case of murder or an inquest. No arrests have been made said Gwala.
