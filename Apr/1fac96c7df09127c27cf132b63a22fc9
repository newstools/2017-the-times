Up until Thembi's acceptance speech for her lifetime achievement award at the Naledi Theatre Awards, many did not know that her husband had died."I believe that time heals but you cannot just say I have stopped mourning," the actress said.The actress opened up about dealing with loss in an interview with Sowetan, detailing how she has found herself asking why she is losing important people in her life.She revealed that that the death of her husband had been "sudden" and that her family has had a hard time accepting that he is gone. Thembi - who has been friends with Joe since the S'gudi S'naysi days - also explained that learning of Joe's death "deeply hurt" her because he always offered her a "shoulder to cry on"."That's why I was deeply hurt by his death. I asked myself what's happening to me. I mean my pillars of strength have gone," she said.Thembi will be playing the role of Gertrude, a businesswoman who was married to a con artist, on the new drama series Broken Vows, which starts on Monday at 8pm.
