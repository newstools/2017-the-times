It was the Stormers fourth successive defeat which started with a home loss against the Lions last month and was followed with two 50-point maulings against the Crusaders and Highlanders before the Hurricanes defeat.The final scoreline was perhaps unfair on the Stormers who showed character and guts to fight back to 22-22 as the match entered the final 15 minutes.But there is no hiding from the fact that they conceded a slew of tries on the night and 23 tries and 161 points in three games on tour. It s the first time in the franchise s history that the Stormers have conceded over 40 points in three consecutive matches.Only poor discipline from the home team kept the Stormers in the game at one stage the Hurricanes conceded six consecutive penalties either side of halftime.Despite the flow of penalties against them and poor goalkicking from fullback Jordie Barrett who missed four conversions the Hurricanes were always comfortable thanks to their sublime attacking skills.Marshalled by halfbacks TJ Perenara and Beauden Barrett the Hurricanes breached the Stormers line when they needed to.Jordie Barrett turned in another breathtaking display of attacking skill which included two tries the first which was an outrageous example of awareness when he ripped the ball out of No. 8 Nizaam Carr s hands in the in-goal area.The Hurricanes opening tries were all conceived through accurate tactical kicking with Beauden Barrett twice landing pinpoint kicks on wing Corey Jane and Jordie Barrett.Although the home team spent less time in the Stormers 22 in the first half than the visitors did in theirs they still managed four first half tries through clever use of the boot.The Stormers tactical kicking was woeful and their only real threat was from rolling mauls which led to a try for replacement hooker Ramone Samuels while Bongi Mbonambi was in the sin bin for collapsing an earlier maul.Fullback SP Marais took over the kicking duties from flyhalf Rob du Preez late in the first half after the latter left the field with his arm in a sling.Marais landed four consecutive penalties either side of half time during a period where the Hurricanes ill discipline cost them momentum and field position.But they rode with the punches and even though the score was tied there was always a feeling that the home team could break out at will.Centre Ngane Laumape eventually put the Hurricanes in front again in the 65th minute after a long build-up and then settled the matter with a try against the run of play 10 minutes later.The Stormers spent most of the time after Laumape s first try ensconced inside the Hurricanes 22-metre area. But eventually they coughed up the ball in midfield and the Hurricanes quickly turned defence into attack.Wing Julian Savea ran over opposite number Cheslin Kolbe from deep to set up Laumape s second try to settle the outcome of the game.Scorers:Hurricanes Tries: Corey Jane Jordie Barrett (2) Julian Savea Ngane Laumape (2) Beauden Barrett.
