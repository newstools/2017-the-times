Organisers say at least 10 000 people are expected to join the second anti-Zuma march this time organised by opposition parties - the DA COPE IFP EFF ACDP APC and UDM.But Zuma will be at the Walter Sisulu Square in Kliptown attending his 75th birthday celebratory rally organised by the ANC.Former Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan who was together with his deputy Mcebisi Jonas axed by Zuma angering South Africans is also celebrating his 58th birthday on the same day. In a message sent to The Times Gordhan said his plans for his birthday are very simple relax and spend the day with family .On the eve of the mass action on Tuesday Zuma was in Westonaria where he conducted a site-visit of the local Agri-Park project.Zuma appeared unfazed by the growing calls for his removal and made no mention of the march but instead beamed when the gathered crowd burst into the Happy Birthday song with the crowd invited to join in Wednesday s celebrations by the local acting mayor. The president is also facing a motion of no confidence debate in parliament which may be postponed after the Constitutional Court allowed parties to file opposing papers in the UDM s urgent application for a secret ballot.Former president Thabo Mbeki on Tuesday urged MPs to put the country first when they vote on a motion of no confidence saying the Constitutional Court had outlined the role of MPs in its Nkandla judgment which criticised parliament for not rapping Zuma over the knuckles by failing to implement the findings of the public protector.Mbeki said that MPs must act as the voice of the people not the voice of the political parties to which they belong .As the political landscape continued to fracture the SA Communist Party in Gauteng broke with the organisation s sentiments about Zuma s leadership saying it would not be throwing its weight behind the march as the EFF and DA were bourgeois . The provincial SACP s views are contrary to the SACP nationally which held a special provincial council over the weekend and resolved that Zuma should resign over the cabinet reshuffle and its consequences.UDM leader Bantu Holomisa said the march was not a numbers game but was intended to deliver a message. Even if we are five the message will be conveyed that Zuma is causing havoc. This sent a chilling message to investors and resulted in our country's investment status downgraded to junk which impacted negatively on our economy he said.Holomisa urged marchers to ensure the protest was peaceful. We cannot say we are ousting a rogue president but engage in hooliganism he said.The SA Police Service and Tshwane metro police have vowed to be out in full force to maintain law and order. Marchers who will arrive in buses and trains will start converging at the Church Square from 9am with the march to the Union Buildings scheduled to start at noon and expected to end at 4pm.Tshwane metro police spokesperson Superintendent Isaac Mahamba said they had a solid plan to smoothly channel the crowds into Church Square.He said those coming from Mpumalanga and east of the city will use the N4 highway and travel along Pretorius Street turning into Paul Kruger street to reach Church Square while those coming from Johannesburg and Olievenhoutbosch will use the N1 and Kgosi Mampuru turning right into WF Nkomo and proceed to Church Square.
