Tankers were used to transport treated water from Bellville Waste Water Treatment Works to the Erica Park sports complex in Belhar which is hosting the Bay Hill Premier Cup featuring 32 teams of under-19 players.City of Cape Town mayoral committee member JP Smith said emergency watering of the pitches for the past week had made a big difference to the state of the drought-hit pitches. Last week it became apparent that the fields at Erica Park were too dry to cope with the tournament he said. I want to thank all of the staff from the fire department and recreation and parks who worked over the weekend to ensure that the fields received maximum attention. Everyone is very relieved that we didn t have to break the 29-year tradition of this tournament and disappoint the teams ... and the over 20 000 spectators who are expected this weekend. Tournament director Patrick Williams said the organising committee was grateful for the council s efforts. I am sure that the Cape Town Football community feel exactly the same. Easter weekend in Cape Town will not be the same without the Bay Hill Premier Cup. Smith said a back-up field at a nearby sports complex had been prepared in case the Erica Park fields did not withstand the tournament which includes an under-19 team from English Premier League Club Swansea City.
