The DJ's star has been on the rise for several years already but reached a whole new level over the last few months.In the wake of his massive show at the prestigious Coachella music festival last year, Black Coffee has really strengthened his international brand, scoring a number of big deals in the process.Meanwhile, we're just here in SA watching in complete awe!Here's just some of the reasons why Black Coffee is pretty much slaying life and music at the moment.He goes overseas more than you go to the shopsThere was a time when a Black Coffee world tour was a massive deal. Now the DJ regularly flies in and out of the country to perform in countries across the globe like he is popping past the shops for bread and milk.
