Zakes has partnered with UNICEF in a Father's Day campaign which aims to highlight the importance of the first year's of a child's life.Speaking to TshisaLIVE at an event in Sandton, Zakes said that South Africans tend to highlight those who are irresponsible."The day we ignore them and don't highlight how irresponsible they can be will be a victory.There needs to be a shift. People do things just to be in the headlines. We talk about things that are not important."Zakes said important issues like being a present father should trend."You can be in and out of your child's life if you want to. You want to be a dad when you want to. That's what has happened in this country."The UNICEF campaign aims to promote finding ways to have a better relationship with your young child and inspire families across South Africa to share their best Father's Day moments.International stars who have joined the campaign include David Beckham, Novak Djokovic, Lewis Hamilton and Hugh Jackman.
