Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe is lined up to portray ANC activist Tim Jenkin, the Capetonian who, with Stephen Lee and Alex Moumbaris, walked out the front door of Pretoria Central in 1979 after cutting wooden keys in the prison workshop.The three, jailed for terrorism, fled to Europe after their escape."I will get excited when I am sitting at the premiere about to watch it for the first time," Jenkin told The Times."It could fall through at any moment, so I don't want to get my hopes up too high."Jenkin has heard of the Harry Potter films and books, but he has never seen or read them.Asked if he felt Radcliffe was the right man to play him, Jenkin said: "I am sure he would. I haven't seen him, so I will have to see."He said he would be travelling to London next week to meet people involved in the film."The script is really a guideline that will no doubt change, but I am not very happy with it at the moment."The story itself is exciting enough without anyone inventing anything," he said.Jenkin, now 68 and living in Cape Town, revealed he was still in contact with his former prison mates."We get together on the anniversary of the escape and have a little Skype party," Jenkin said, laughing.Lee, he said, had married and lives in England. Moumbaris lives in France. Jenkin married in London six weeks after the escape, but divorced two years later.He remarried and has two sons. One lives in Johannesburg and the other is in the UK learning to farm."They're not terribly interested in my stories," he said. "They have read my book and seen the documentary and so on."The movie, with UK producer David Barron, will take its audience through the painstaking work the trio put in to make keys for 10 doors out of wood right under the noses of the prison guards.It is based on Jenkin's book, Inside Out: Escape from Pretoria Prison.
