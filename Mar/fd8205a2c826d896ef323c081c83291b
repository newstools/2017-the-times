Athletics SA created the confusion when they decided in their infinite wisdom to schedule the national championship on April 21-22 the same weekend as the IAAF s World Relay Championships.Questions were asked whether Van Niekerk and other South African sprinters would travel to the Bahamas or stick around and put on the greatest athletics show ever seen in Potchefstroom. Wayde will be in Potch I will be in Potch and putting on a show for South Africa Van Niekerk said on Thursday. I think that it is time for us South African (athletes) to give South Africans a show right here at home and you do not have to watch it on TV. Hopefully we can get the stadium quite packed and put up a good show for South Africa. The date of the World Relay Championships was known well before the dates for the national championships and yet ASA still confirmed the schedule.With Van Niekerk confirming his participation in Potchefstroom the 100m is expected to produce fireworks with a potentially mouthwatering final lineup a real possibility.The world 400m record-holder could potentially line up in the final against national record holder Akani Simbine Thando Roto defending champion Henricho Bruintjies and even young gun Gift Leotlela.Van Niekerk did not want to make predications and said it would be lightning-quick race that could be the highlight of the event. It s quite a long season and (Simbine s 9.89 seconds 100m national record) is a massive South African record to beat. But we will put out our best foot and see what happens. I mean I am not someone to count my chickens before they hatch and I will take my opportunities as they come. I will give it my all I will focus on myself and we will see what happens on that day.
