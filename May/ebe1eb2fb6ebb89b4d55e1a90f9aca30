 Despite aggressive recovery treatments and rehab to the injury it hasn t healed sufficiently to allow me to safely compete at Comrades this year the accounting lecturer said in a statement on Monday. I won t be running the Comrades Marathon but I will be one of the supporters. Even though everything in me wants to go and run Comrades I have made the heart-breaking decision to listen to my medical team and withdraw from the race. Wostmann picked up the injury during the Two Oceans Marathon last month forcing her to pull out of that event mid-race. I picked up a hamstring niggle where it was later diagnosed as a neural injury which was far more serious than originally presumed said Wostmann who won the Two Oceans and Comrades double in 2015.After keeping her Two Oceans crown last year she looked on track for a second double but cramps stole her stride in the Comrades down run and she was beaten into second place by Charne Bosman. I have received so much energy and motivation from the Comrades supporters cheering me on in past years and I hope I can give that back to my fellow Comrades as they complete their journey this year Wostmann said. I wish every one of my Comrades a life-changing adventure from Durban up to Pietermaritzburg this year. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
