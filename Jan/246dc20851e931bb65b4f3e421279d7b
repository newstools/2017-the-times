It is more instructive, perhaps, to put aside the crystal ball and to flip back to the South African story already written - for it is in the chapters now completed that lie the clues to tomorrow.The historian Yuval Noah Harari argues that society is powered by "fictions" which inspire common beliefs, behaviours and collective organisation that shape the norm.These "fictions", he argues, change with time, being replaced by new ones which lead us down other paths of behaviour which drive the seismic changes in human history.In South Africa, Archbishop Desmond Tutu gave us a Rainbow Nation but it was a fiction whose promise was never realised. Next came Thabo Mbeki with the African Renaissance and his "I am an African" speech.These were fragrant with possibility as inspiring fictions but, thanks to the ANC's realpolitik, they left us with nothing but an ex-president and a funky song.And so we come to Jacob Zuma, whose fiction features a central narrative populated by shady characters in search of a cogent plot. B-grade fiction it may be, but it is nevertheless inspiring unexpected behaviour which promises hope.Consider last year's indictment by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng of Zuma's behaviour over Nkandla. Remember the courage of public protector Thuli Madonsela in writing her final State of Capture report.Reflect on the Save South Africa campaign comprising a myriad figures, many bravely breaking ranks with tradition to remind us to "demand those who dishonour our constitution be immediately removed".Those are the seeds of a new South African fiction. It is a fiction yet to fully take hold, but when it does what we will witness will be profound. That is what 2017 holds.
