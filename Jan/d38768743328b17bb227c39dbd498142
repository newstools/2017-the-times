The Bafana Bafana defender was dropped from the team for disciplinary reasons in Ajax s final premiership game of 2016 a 1-0 success over Chippa United.Neither coach Stanley Menzo nor Efstathiou would give details of what led to the axing except to say that Coetzee had crossed some sort of line. It was for disciplinary reasons full stop."That is all I will say Efstathiou said at the time before confirming that the axing was the decision of Menzo and not club management who nevertheless backed the coach. He is a very strict disciplinarian and that s good it s what these young boys need. But Efstathiou confirms that there have been no lasting consequences and that Coetzee is once again available for selection when the league programme resumes after the African Nations Cup next month. He returned to training with the rest of the team on January 10 and has been preparing for the restart of the league like everybody else. - TMG Digital
