The competition watchdog has already granted Barclays Africa conditional immunity for its assistance in the investigation and on Monday handed Citigroup a reduced fine of $5-million for its co-operation.The commission said last week it had found more than a dozen local and foreign banks colluded to coordinate trading the South African and US currencies using a chat room called "ZAR Domination". It recommended fines amounting to 10% of the banks' South African revenues in a scandal that has piled political pressure on the country's big four local banks and raised questions about their grip on the South African economy."We did, through the investigation, receive a leniency application from Barclays/Absa, which co-operated and gave us more information," commission head Tembinkosi Bonakele told a parliamentary committee yesterday."We have a conditional agreement with them on immunity but this is subject to confirmation depending on the extent of their co-operation." Citigroup agreed to pay $5-million in settlement for its role in the cartel.Citibank announced that it would improve its internal systems and monitoring processes after it agreed to pay the penalty.Bonakele said that, while the amount of the Citigroup penalty was "low", the commission had made the compromise as part of a bigger prosecution case."I would say that the settlement was low, but as a prosecutor you sometimes have to make these calls because we have a bigger case to run," he said.
