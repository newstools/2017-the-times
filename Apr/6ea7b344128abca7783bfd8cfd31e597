Ayanda recently returned to work and immediately set out to organise a birthday celebration to honour her late husband, and even spent a night out with the girls recently.She said that the monthly anniversary of her husband's death has changed from a day of sorrow to one of worship."The 5th... has become my Covenant day to seek the face of God more, because he chose this day to welcome you home," she wrote in a tribute to her husband recently.But the mourning process has been difficult for Ayanda.After her husband's death she immediately started a traditional mourning period which saw her step out of the spotlight and not talk to the media. In the first 30 days of this period, the nation was only given glimpses of Ayanda's struggles to come to terms with the death of her husband.Ayanda's close friend Norma Gigaba was there for her during those days and said that she was left heartbroken and speechless by the pain that Ayanda was going through."Seeing my friend going through so much pain really broke my heart. I always thought that I was strong, but yesterday I ran out of words. I'm going to be with her again today but I'm still out of words," Norma wrote.Ayanda made her first public appearance since Sfiso's death at his memorial services and funeral. At each event she read a short note to her husband declaring her love for him. She made another rare appearance at the memorial of Lundi Tyamara, but refused to speak to media.In her first interview since the death of her husband, Ayanda gave a blow-by-blow account of Sfiso's last moments.After recounting the moments leading up to his death, Ayanda broke down with emotion."I went next to him. I asked him not to leave me. I begged him. I even tried to move him, but he was gone," she told Ukhozi FM's Laddy D.
