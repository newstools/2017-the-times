Yesterday the council launched the fifth SA HIV Prevalence, Incidence, Behaviour and Communication Survey, during which 60,000 people will give blood and fill in questionnaires.Fieldworkers will over nine months visit 22,000 households to take anonymous HIV tests and ask questions.But people in wealthier areas and traditionally Indian and white people are reluctant to let council-identified fieldworkers into their homes."We get information and statistics [on these groups] but the data is not enough to draw substantive conclusions," said Khangelani Zuma, the executive director of the Research Methodology and Data Centre and head of biostatistics at the Human Sciences Research Council."We have seen a growing number of whites and Indians in the fourth study, but we need more of them [to participate]."Questions include whether South Africans think they are at risk of HIV or not."Over the years our data has provided an important gauge of the health status of South Africans," said Geoff Setswe, deputy executive director in the national HIV/Aids, STI &amp; TB Council.The results help the government to fund and plan efforts to treat and prevent HIV based on accurate data."What the [previous] work has done is show us the scale of the problem in the country," said Crain Soudien, the CEO of the research council.For the population-based study, fieldworkers visit 1457 specified areas across the country so they can paint a nationally representative picture of the country's infection rates.Previous studies were carried out in 2002, 2005, 2008 and 2012 and the data has helped researchers map out trends in HIV infection. Unicef, the US government, the Global Fund, the US Centres for Disease Control and Gauteng province are among the funders.
