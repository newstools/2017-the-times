The Baddest rapper was set to headline the Mzansi Hip-Hop Festival on Saturday but pulled out at the 11th hour because there was apparently not enough people there to support him.When asked on Twitter why he had not performed as promised, AKA told a fan: "There wasn't enough people for me to perform. 500 minimum. It's in my contract."We negotiated with the organizer to come back to the event after our show at Nasrec if the gig filled up. We never got the call. So yah. AKA (@akaworldwide) June 4, 2017The problem is that if I get on a stage with an empty crowd .... y'all gonna call it "AKA's show" .... when it's simply a booking. AKA (@akaworldwide) June 4, 2017I made the decision a long time ago that I only want to perform to big crowds. *shrug* AKA (@akaworldwide) June 4, 2017We negotiated with the organizer to come back to the event after our show at Nasrec if the gig filled up.

I didn't want to do this. pic.twitter.com/9ibAxELUHdNtukza responded by saying it was not the organisers' fault that people didn't rush to see AKA."We have different images abuti, my previous pic was just before a performance. [It is] not my fault [that] people didn't gather [a]round you," he tweeted, with a laughing face emoji.He claimed that the issue may have something to do with AKA demanding to perform two hours earlier than scheduled.@akaworldwide so much respect I have for you, ok tweet hawu hebanna.
