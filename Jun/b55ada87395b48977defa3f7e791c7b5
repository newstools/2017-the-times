Vodacom, through the Vodacom Change the World initiative, is calling for young South Africans to volunteer their time in giving back to their communities through the non-profit organisations (NPOs) of their choice for a year, while getting paid. The Vodacom Change the World programme was introduced in 2011, giving individuals the opportunity to volunteer their time and skills to work for a NPO for 12 months. To date, 111 volunteers have already made a difference working with a wide range of NPOs. This year’s programme will focus on giving young graduates volunteerism opportunities and real work experience while promoting the culture and spirit of volunteerism. The country’s skills development is a challenge while the unemployment rate remains stubbornly high. To help address this challenge, the Vodacom Foundation empowers young people through the Vodacom Change the World programme. “Through this programme, volunteers are afforded a unique opportunity to do something close to their heart, while imparting their skills to help society. The programme continues to go from strength to strength as it touches the lives of ordinary South Africans. If you would like to do the same, apply today,” says Takalani Netshitenzhe, chief officer of corporate affairs at Vodacom Group. If you believe you have what it takes to change the world, then now’s the time to apply to be one of the 2017 Vodacom Change the World volunteers. All you need to do is to approach an NPO of your choice and gain its support and agreement on your role, goals and monthly salary. Should you be interested in applying, entries for the Change the World programme can be submitted from June 20 to July 31 2017. This article was paid for by the Vodacom Foundation.
