This comes after the ANC s highest decision-making body the national executive committee (NEC) took a decision that Lungisa should quit the position. "The NEC took a decision [and] reaffirmed its previous decision. It left further action to the province rightfully because regions are under the jurisdiction of provinces " said ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe. He was speaking at a post NEC meeting briefing at the party's headquarters Luthuli House on Monday afternoon. Lungisa has been in a stand-off with Mantashe and the provincial ANC after he was elected as regional chair while also serving as PEC member a move that Mantashe warned was against the party s constitution.Mantashe asked Lungisa to resign from the regional structure but he openly refused claiming Mantashe read the constitution wrongly as there "was no such prohibition in the party s constitution".Lungisa was given a deadline to resign from his position last week Thursday failing which he would face disciplinary action. - TMG Digital
