Jay-Z sings: I'm takin wages down in Vegas just in case Tyson have a major night off / That's clean money, the tax write-off. Cohen's verdict: 8/10 Gambling winnings are normally taxable, but according to Investopedia the good thing about gambling tax law for big winners is that, unlike income tax, gambling tax always remains at 25%. Jay-Z loses marks because betting against Tyson could get you your ear bitten off. Jay-Z sings: I bought some artwork for 1-million / 2 years later, that s**t worth 2-million / Few years later, that s**t worth 8-million / I can't wait to give this s**t to my children. Cohen's verdict: 8/10 The problem is that people tend to judge based on what they hear about the huge auctions, but don't get to see the whole market. The average compound return on investment art, held for between five and 10 years, is around 4%, much less than the stock market, gold, or even investment wine. Jay-Z loses extra marks for being an artist and not realising that like bad rap, bad paintings can bomb. Jay-Z sings: I'm overchargin' for what they did to the Cold Crush / Pay us like you owe us for all the years that you hold us / We can talk, but money talks so talk mo' bucks. Cohen's verdict: 0/10 0 The Cold Crush is a hip-hop group famously exploited by the music industry. It makes no sense for Jay-Z to deliberately overcharge because others suffered. The laws of supply and demand suggest that his market would decline if he did - just ask Kanye. Jay-Z sings: Wanna know what's more important than throwin' away money at a strip club? Credit. Cohen's verdict: 10/10 Nice advice, Jay-Z, simple and to the point. Debt bad. Credit good. The whole banking system is geared towards foisting expensive debt onto everyone who can possibly afford to pay it. The easiest way to not lose money is to avoid their blandishments and live modestly. Like Jay-Z.
