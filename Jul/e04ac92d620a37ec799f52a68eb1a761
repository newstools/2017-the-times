Dramatic footage, filmed in Kenya's Maasai Mara National Reserve from the air, shows a zebra’s lucky escape from a crocodile – straight into the jaws of a lioness on the other side of the riverbank. The live kill was shot from a SafariLIVE hot air balloon. The adult zebra is seen wading through the river and making a dash past the jaws of an awaiting crocodile. Just when you think it is safe on the banks of the river, an awaiting lioness takes the zebra down. Another lioness then joins in on the feast. An unlucky day for the zebra.
