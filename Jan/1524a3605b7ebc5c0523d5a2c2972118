Tshabalala resigned in December 2014 because of the controversy around her qualifications. She claimed to have a BCom degree and a post-graduate diploma in labour relations from the University of South Africa.She is expected to be present before the parliamentary ad hoc committee on the SABC board inquiry on Friday.Cope said it laid fraud charges against Tshabalala for misrepresenting her education qualifications in July last year.The SAPS told Cope after more than 18 months that it was still busy with the investigation and will hand over the docket to the National Prosecutor Authority for a decision. Cope wants to reiterate that misrepresentation of education qualifications is a serious offence and believes that sufficient evidence exists to charge Ellen Tshabalala - we cannot understand why the police are dragging their feet with this investigation spokesman Dennis Bloem said.He said the fraudulent misrepresentation of education qualifications in our country could not be treated lightly. Cope is hopeful that the appearance of the former chairwoman of the SABC board Ellen Tshabalala before the parliamentary ad hoc committee on Friday will speed up the investigation of the fraud charges that were laid against her in 2015. - TMG Digital
