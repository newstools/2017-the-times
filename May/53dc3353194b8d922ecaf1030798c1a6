The Daily Dispatch can reveal that the warrant for Ntutu s arrest was signed in March but was never effected as Hawks bosses feared their action could be interpreted as an attempt to influence the ANC regional conference in Amathole which took place in the same month. At the conference Ntutu was re-elected as regional secretary.But last week Ntutu along with businessman Regis Masuku and a staff member in Mnquma s supply chain management division known as Zanele were given notices to hand themselves over to the police on Tuesday.The Hawks investigation is linked to a fraudulent refuse bags tender worth R10-million.The trio are expected to make a brief court appearance and their case is likely to be postponed to May 8 when businessman Sive Nombembe who benefited from the plastic bags tender through his company Big Event Boy makes his third court appearance.This article appeared in the Daily Dispatch TMG Digital/DispatchLIVE
