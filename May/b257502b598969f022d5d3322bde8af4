No motion of no confidence can take place without a secret ballot Ngcukaitobi contended.Anton Katz for the IFP argued that the separation of powers is at the heart of the application. Separation of powers requires parliament to oversee the executive. He argued that the court should deal with all motions of no confidence as a matter of principle. Our sword is the motion of no confidence. That motion should have teeth. It would be absurd to have a secret ballot when it comes to electing a president and not when voting to remove him Katz said.He told the court that the IFP has for many years complained about the motion of no confidence not being conducted by way of a secret ballot. The IFP has been motivating for many years for a secret ballot.
