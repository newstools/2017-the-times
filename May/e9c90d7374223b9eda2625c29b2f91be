"Ongoing volatility in international oil prices has been matched by swings in the Rand/US dollar exchange rate making fuel price predictions as tricky as ever " the AA said in a statement on Tuesday morning.It said that while the rand started the month strongly against the dollar - which bodes well for petrol prices - it had since weakened. It was a similar case with the international cost of petroleum which started the month relatively cheap but "made something of a comeback in the past few days".Despite this volatility the consumer was "still winning" the association said."The current data (predicts) a drop of 24 cents a litre for petrol 20 cents for diesel and 21 cents for illuminating paraffin. We wouldn't rely on these figures though since a lot could change by month end " the AA commented.-TMG Digital/TimesLIVE
