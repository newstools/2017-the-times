The 22-year-old left-back adds defensive strength for coach Eric Tinkler and arrives from Mozambique champions Ferroviario de Beira. The club have been tracking the left-footed 22-year old for some time and after the international friendly between Bafana and Mozambique [in November last year] City said in a statement. The first-choice left-back has been the key man for both club and country and at such a young age we are excited to see him make his name in the Blue and Gold. City have used a number of options in the left-back position so far this season following the exit of first-choice Aubrey Modiba to SuperSport United.Former junior international Ebrahim Seedat and Thato Mokeke who is on loan from SuperSport have shared the responsibility.Dove is the first signing from outside of the club for City this season though they have also promoted junior Raphael Georgiades to the first team.The club who are joint top of the Absa Premiership and were crowned Telkom Knockout champions last month in the maiden season of their existence have released Australian midfielder Matt Sim and Latvian defender Renars Rode in this window. - TMG Digital
