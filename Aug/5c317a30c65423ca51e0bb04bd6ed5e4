The saying that there is an app for everything is true - and this includes health and fitness. Here are three apps worth checking out. Lifesum focuses on diet. In the beginning you enter your height, weight and gender as usual as well as your goal weight. Unlike fad diets, it lets you eat what you want - in moderation. It uses your current weight and goal weight to calculate your recommended daily calories. You then log what you eat at every meal and it adds calories to your day, ultimately filling your recommended allowance. You can also log your exercise, which deducts calories from your meals. You can track your progress visually through a monthly or daily graph. Lifesum also offers specific dietary plans but I did not find those particularly helpful. If you upgrade to premium, you get access to a bounty of recipes for every meal. Lifesum has made me more conscious of what and how much I eat. While Lifesum focuses on diet, SweatÂ focuses on fitness. Linked to Instagram fitness sensation Kayla Itsines, it tailors a programme to your needs with exercises getting progressively harder as your endurance improves. Exercises targeted at legs, arms and abs take 28 minutes each and require no special equipment, which is great if you are new to home fitness. This app that walks you through yoga poses. It shows you pictures of the poses and times you as you do them. As you do more, they get more difficult. It also gives you rest time as you move to the next pose. It is no yoga instructor but it is a good imitation. These three apps are golden nuggets in the sea of health and fitness apps. Available on iOS and Android, I hope they bring you many calm hours of healthy eating and exercise.
