The transaction would make Seriti the second-largest supplier of coal to Eskom. Seriti is owned by Masimong Group Holdings, Thebe Investment Corporation, Zungu Investments Company and Community Investment Holdings Projects. The company intends to bring employees and communities into the structure as shareholders. Seriti CEO Mike Teke said the deal "represents a significant step forward in our vision to become a black-controlled, broad-based South African mining champion, and a coal player of significant size and scale".Anglo's decision to sell the Eskom-linked collieries stemmed from the parastatal's demands for coal to be supplied from 51% black-owned mining companies.Anglo has said it could also sell its majority stake in Kumba Iron Ore. With the soaring iron-ore price in the past year and the restructuring of Kumba, the asset is generating strong cash flows and Anglo may yet pull back from wanting to sell its stake. - BDLive
