Frenchman Romain Grosjean, who is head of the Grand Prix Drivers' Association, and Mexican Sergio Perez both said the new kerb could cause airborne accidents."It looks like a take-off ramp," said Grosjean of the Haas team. "If you clip your front wing, it could take it off because you've made a small mistake and it will fly you straight into the wall."Force India driver Perez said: "I think the one we had before was big enough and if you hit it, it will send you to the wall ... So, now, I think this [new] one will probably send you to the grandstand."The new kerbs are part of a revised layout around the swimming pool, which also includes a revision of the speed bumps that follow in the sequence of corners leading to the Rascasse hairpin.
