Struggling Highlands in second-last place with just 13 points from 16 games need all the help and manpower they can get as they prepare to take on Polokwane City at Park s Makhulong Stadium base in Tembisa (kickoff: 3.30pm).Shalulile 23 who was heavily linked with Mamelodi Sundowns before an ankle injury kept him out of the first half of the season came off the bench for his first minutes in eight months as struggling Highlands returned from the six-week PSL break with a 3-0 defeat away against Cape Town City in midweek.Shalulile had been instrumental in Park winning promotion last season and although Igesund thinks it will take him time to get back up to speed believes he could be influential for the side again. Peter hasn t played for almost a year so when we were 2-0 down [against Cape Town City on Tuesday] I thought it was a good chance to bring him back into it quickly Igesund said. If the score was 2-2 or 1-0 I wouldn t have brought him on because I don t think he was quite ready but this will have brought him on a bit now. Peter is a nice player and he did well last season and was one of the top scorers. It has been terrible time for him but he has shown a lot of character to fight his way back. Apart from finding his scoring form for Highlands Shalulile was also red hot for Namibia before his injury netting in Africa Nations Cup qualification wins over Burundi (3-1) and Niger (1-0) in his two most recent matches.Meanwhile Igesund knows the perilous position of his side as they prepare to host City on Sunday. We are in a battle at the moment we can t kid ourselves he said. But if you look at the results [in midweek] all those teams down there lost as well as one or two who are only a couple of points ahead of us. We win two or three games and we will be OK. Free State Stars lost Ajax lost Baroka lost and we lost. So there is no real change the only difference is that each team now has a match less to play. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
