The harassment which university management declined to comment on is said to have seen the lecturer attempting to force himself on his colleagues over the past 18 months.While it is not known what prompted the professor s victims to come forward now TimesLIVE understands that there may be another lecturer who was recently harassed and threatened.University spokesman Shirona Patel said: The university cannot comment on processes involving any staff member if the processes are not finalised. Complaints against the professor were apparently laid by the three by staff members at the university's gender equity office earlier this month.TimesLIVE has learnt that a senior advocate appointed by the gender equity office is currently conducting the investigation and is said to be preparing to hand over his findings to university management on Friday.It is also understood that the professor has laid counter-complaints against his accusers.A university source said the issue was highly complicated. No one really knows what is going on. There are complaints and counter-complaints. The whole thing is becoming very messy with apparently more people coming forward. There is definitely a lot more to this entire matter. - TMG Digital/TimesLIVE
