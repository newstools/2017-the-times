On a balance of probabilities the strength of the State s case is subject to serious doubt she said citing case law making it clear that the same doubts over the strength of the case was in itself an exceptional circumstance which the onus was on the accused to prove for a court to consider granting bail.She cited this in all three judgments. The likelihood of investigations taking a long time to be finalised and for further evidence to be brought against the accused if any to link them to the crime is in itself an exceptional circumstance she said of all three men.While she noted that certain elements of the defence and the State s case were important she would not deal with the merits of the case but simply weigh the interests of justice based on evidence presented.Msimeki is expected to decide on the bail of the three other accused Simon Thokwane France Manaka and Cosmos Ntanzi tomorrow (Tuesday).
