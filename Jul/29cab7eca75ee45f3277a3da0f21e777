Rapper Cassper Nyovest was never ready for the backlash when he unveiled his range of tracksuits which are selling at his Family Tree merchandise store for R1,500 per set. Twitter zoned in on the rapper for the costly price tag attached to the tracksuits, which some said cost more than their month's groceries. While many fashionistas agreed the tracksuit was nice, they were a little more sticky when they saw the R1,500 price tag. In true Mzansi style Twitter users took aim at Cassper throughÂ a string of hilarous memes. At first Cassper assured fans the reason for the price was "quality over quantity," but as the debate around the tracksuits grew hotter he hit back at his haters. Twitter hadn't been this excited about clothes since Riky Rick nearly shut down Twitter when he announced that he was selling vests for R700. Fans were quick to make the comparison between the two.
