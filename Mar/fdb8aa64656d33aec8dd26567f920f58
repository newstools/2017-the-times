This is among the slew of questions police are trying to find answers to after the brazen and well-planned robbery, which is believed to have netted the thieves about R200-million.Various sources have said a police escort meant to accompany the security company vehicle transporting the high-value cargo container did not arrive on time.But acting national police commissioner Lieutenant-General Khomotso Phahlane was playing his cards close to his chest at a press briefing yesterday. "As to whether the police were there - where they were supposed to be; those are the kind of things we are referring to when we talk about security breaches," he said, confirming an inside job had not been ruled out.Phahlane said the vetting of police officers stationed at OR Tambo was carried out at different levels - with more stringent background checks being done if the officer was required to gain access to high-security areas.He appealed to the media to give the authorities space to investigate the daring heist.While he refused to answer questions about the robbery, he hit out at reports in The Times that revealed how the robbery went down, saying the mention of vehicles used as "police vehicles" was "fake news.""People must not jump to conclusions with limited information," he said, adding that media reports were "peddling distorted pictures to the nation". "We are going to increase and intensify our efforts there. In no way can we take anything for granted after what happened on Tuesday. We will deal with those gaps manifesting themselves in the security system but we cannot provide more details on other measures," he said.About allegations of a "turf war" between the Hawks and SAPS at the airport, Phahlane said: "There is no war between SAPS and the Hawks - they are a family and they work together everywhere. I can't respond to what was said outside this space."Airports Company of SA CEO Bongani Maseko said he could not give figures for the number of criminal incidents at the airport in the past 12 months."Those statistics would fall under the SAPS mandate," Maseko said.Phahlane told journalists he could assure the public of South Africa that they were safe.
