Thousands of parents and students are having to dig deep to pay for private tertiary instituations as full house signs go up at public universities around the country.Only two of out 10 pupils from the matric class of 2016 were able to register at South Africa's 24 public universities leaving thousands of other students to pursue their careers at private facilities.One former Durban High School pupil who wanted to study law will be paying R72 500 for his first year of Bachelor of Law at Varsity College s Durban North campus which is about R30 000 more than what he would have paid at the University of KwaZulu-Natal had he been accepted.The teenager's father who did not want to be named said while he had tried to financially prepare for his son s university education he didn't take into account the demand for spaces at public universities and that he would have to consider a private college.His son who scored Bs and Cs in his matric exam applied timeously at the University of Johannesburg University of Pretoria and University of KwaZulu-Natal to study B Comm Law but was rejected at UKZN and UP. UJ came back with his second choice which was psychology. I think it was a matter of space and children who did far better than him got place he said.The father said they decided to leave the choice to his son who decided to study at Varsity College in Durban. Had he chosen to go to UJ to study psychology it would not only be the tuition and accommodation costs but one had to take into account all the other incidental expenses. For every exercise one starts you have to work on a budget. We left the decision to him and said to him whichever he does we would support him. UKZN was between R40 000 and R45 000 while Varsity College is R72 500 this year just for the tuition. We still need to buy the textbooks and maybe additional stationery or technology. Just the fee comparison is a huge difference he said.According to private institutions Varsity College and Monash South Africa a B Comm law degree for first year students costs R72 500 and R79 900 respectively. At Wits the average tuition fees in the faculty of commerce law and management ranges from R44 740 to R51 380 and approximately R39 170 for B Comm Law at UKZN.Louise Wiseman of the Independent Institute of Education and managing director at Varsity College said a recent consumer survey showed that their good academic reputation their choice of courses the location of their campuses the credibility of their qualifications as well as small class sizes accounted for their high registration rate. "We have been on a growth trajectory for our brands for the past three to five years and this has not changed." Wiseman said the fact that they were not state subsidised and that fees were their only form on income resulted in their higher costs.Pietermaritzburg student Muhammed Seepye said he chose to go to Varsity College to study B Comm financial management because of their smaller class sizes."We don't have the worry of strikes and disruptions in lectures.Students are forced to attend lectures as there is a register which is signed " said Seepye.Dr Nic Spaull an education researcher at Stellenbosch University said between 2009 and 2016 the number of matric students that graduated and were eligible for university increased from about 100 000 to more than 160 000. That was a more than 60% increase. At the same time university enrolment has only expanded by about five to 10 percent. In this context it s not surprising that the private sector has expanded to absorb some of the demand for higher education said Spaull.Private school operator Curro which has a teacher training college in Embury KwaZulu-Natal will be opening two new higher education institutions in Midrand and Pretoria. A bachelor of education at Embury this year costs approximately R57 000 which includes study material. This is opposed to about R33 850 at UKZN and an average of R32 030 for tuition fees at Wits.
