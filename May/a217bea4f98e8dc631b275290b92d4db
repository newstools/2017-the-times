De Zalze fence didn't make the buck stop says Van Breda's lawyerHowever Judge Siraj Desai objected to the way in which he was interpreting Myongane s words as spoken by her Shona interpreter in court. You are entitled to cross-examine as you wish Desai told Combrink but this is torturous. There has been no suggestion that there was another axe.
