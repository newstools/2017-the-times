Kevin stars as a strange but charismatic professor who has a romantic relationship with a married couple in a new Amazon Prime series called I Love Dick, and told TshisaLIVE that he isn't chasing the title of sex symbol anymore."I really don't see myself as a sex symbol to be honest. I think maybe I am attractive but the strange thing is it's all kind of changes over the years. When I was younger teenagers found me attractive. A few years later moms found me attractive. And now I think grandmothers find me attractive. So yeah maybe to your grandmother," he said with a chuckle.The series, adapted from a feminist novel, centers on a struggling married couple who became obsessed with a professor and in the process discovered things about themselves and their sexuality.Kevin said that the series was important to break down stigmas."I really think it challenges the norms of sexuality in society but at the same time it has elements that everyone can relate to. On the surface it is entertaining but there's a real important story behind it that I think is important to share," he added.Kevin has played dozens of roles in a career that has spanned nearly 40 years but admitted that he found it difficult to adapt to the role at first."It was different. (Playwright) Sarah Gubbins wanted to work in a different way to what I normally do. I was resistant at first but she really sold it to me and I ended up loving the series, he said.The series will be available to watch for South African subscribers of Amazon Prime and Kevin said that he wished he could return to South Africa to show it off personally to his fans here."I was in South Africa to shoot a film in the early 90s and loved it. I loved the sun and the scenery and the people. I haven't gone back but I would love to visit again," he added.I Love Dick will premiere on Amazon Prime Video on May 12.
