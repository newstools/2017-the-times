Driver kept going! pic.twitter.com/o7FT4iXsAoA police source in the neighbouring town of Menton said: "Mr Froome filed a complaint at the police station in Beausoleil, where he was met by an officer. He was very calm."He was hit by a vehicle which was right on his tail. He wasn't hurt but his bike was in bits."The problem is that he does not have the registration number of the car and it will be a bit complicated (to find the motorist)."Police will study CCTV footage along the road, the source said.Froome's team Sky said he returned home to get a spare bike and continued his training after the incident.Spanish star cyclist Alberto Contador tweeted the picture of Froome's mangled bike and the words: "No comment...!!!"Last month, former Giro d'Italia winner Michele Scarponi was killed when the 37-year-old Astana team rider was knocked off his bike after colliding with a van while training near his home in central Italy.Froome will defend his title when the Tour de France begins in Dusseldorf, Germany, on July 1.
