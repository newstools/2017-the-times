We would like to warn those Members of Parliament who do not know how to vote on April 18 that they should vote for Zuma. The league lashed out at former finance minister Pravin Gordhan who they accused of thinking that he was bigger than the ANC. We chose this Jacob Zuma that they want to leave. We elected him with 60%. If Msholozi is a criminal why is he not in jail because criminals are in jail said the league s Thinta Cibane.Earlier provincial youth league secretary Thanduxolo Sabelo said if the Democratic Alliance wanted to govern the country they must first ask for votes. He said the DA will never govern this country. Zuma is the president of the ANC until December 2017. Zuma is the president of this country until 2019. And this coming December we will elect Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma as ANC president so that she can become the president of the country in 2019 he said.Sabelo lashed out at those defending Gordhan saying he was appointed by Zuma who also had a prerogative to remove him as minister . We are warning Pravin that he must respect the president and we want to remind him that in 2009 he had not been elected. It was Zuma who made him a minister said Sabelo.Mtshali told the gathering there would be no reconciliation in South Africa until white people brought their land back and the economy was given back to black hands.
