His sacked deputy, Mcebisi Jonas, added: "If you look at everything in South Africa in the past few years, there is a certain pattern.

Kubayi makes her presence knownIt is reasonable to assume the pair were referring to connections between politicians and the Gupta family and a greater web of nefarious interests.South Africa's proposed nuclear deal with Russia is one of those dots we need to connect and which was last week declared invalid by the High Court in Cape Town.
