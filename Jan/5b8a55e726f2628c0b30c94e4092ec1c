The Western Cape produced the top three maths pupils in the matric class of 2016 and principals and teachers at their schools agreed that quality teaching and support at primary school level were the keys to success.Greg Hassenkamp principal at Hermanus High which produced South Africa's top mathematics pupil Conrad Strydom said the school focused on preparing pupils for tertiary education and mathematics and science are important subjects. We are very chuffed with the results. We ve got quality maths and science teachers at our school said Hassenkamp. Second spot went to Bronson Rudner of South African College High School in Newlands where principal Ken Ball said the 117 matriculants who took maths averaged 73.8%. SACS is just an all-around talented school. We strive for excellence in everything and have to set the bar high. We have professional and competent teachers with a great work ethic said Ball. Ren e Fourie a member of the management team at Rustenberg Girls High in Rondebosch which produced Hannah Clayton the final member of the top three said: You don't suddenly get good grades in matric. It starts in primary school and takes parental support. The school's head of sciences and mathematics Bridget Cameron said the key to its success was small streamed classes. In our context it works and it s the nature of the teachers. There is no shame in being in the bottom class. In fact pupils like it as they get more attention from the teacher said Cameron.
