United have incurred Safa's wrath by refusing to release players for the tournament in South Korea.Seemingly aware of the club versus country minefield he is about to wade into by virtue of being the new Bafana Bafana coach, Baxter pleaded for more harmony between clubs and the national association."I didn't say we would not release players because I'm not the one making the decision," Baxter said."I don't like the club versus country scenario. I want it to be a club and country situation. I'm sure the club would love to help but there's the question of what the rules are and what the situation is."That, I can't tell you."Supersport and PSL log leaders Bidvest Wits are refusing to release Teboho Mokoena, Reeve Frosler and Phakamani Mahlambi and could have the book thrown at them."You have to look at the rules, have a good dialogue and reach some consensus because the most important thing we need in South Africa is co-operation across all levels," said Baxter. "If we all pull in the same direction, South Africa could be a powerhouse in football. It's an issue we must resolve."- TMG Digital/TMG Sport
