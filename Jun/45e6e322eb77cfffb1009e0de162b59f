The ANC has "without doubt" a chance of losing power in 2019. So says DA leader Mmusi Maimane in the wake of the party's two-day federal council meeting. According to him‚ the country was going into a "critical time" as voters were fed up with high unemployment‚ the "destruction of South Africa's economy" and "the selling off of South Africa to the Guptas". Maimane‚ who was speaking to The Times on Sunday‚ said the situation made the ANC vulnerable. This "seismic shift" in SA politics made the ruling party beatable - particularly by a coalition government. "I think coalitions are the future‚" he said‚ adding that in order for a team-up to unseat the ANC‚ all parties‚ including his‚ had to keep growing. "We've got to do our part. We've got to ensure that we grow in all areas and that where we govern‚ we govern well‚" he said. He said that the party's polling data‚ presented at the federal council meeting‚ showed "that the DA is gaining ground on the ANC". "It is greatly encouraging to report that the ANC is polling below 50%‚ which means that it can be unseated at the next election‚" he said. "The theme emerging from this DA Federal Council is clear: time is running out to save South Africa. Our current government is slowly destroying our precious country‚ with the ANC on course to lose the next election. The DA will work night and day to unseat the corrupt Gupta-led ANC government from office. We have set goals and targets for the Road to 2019‚ and we will work tirelessly to achieve them." - TimesLIVE
