The Brazilians now face a tough task in next Saturday s return in Kampala where the aggregate winner advances to the group phase of the continent s top club competition.KCCA need only win 1-0 to advance on the away goals rule,The two Sundowns centre backs showed the forwards how to do it with the goals as Bangaly Soumaharo headed home unmarked at the back post in the second minute, followed by a penalty from Ricardo Nascimento soon thereafter.The Ugandans looked to be suffering from stage fright with shock defending to allow Soumaharo to easily head home Tebego Langerman s cross.Then followed a ludicrous push by Joseph Ochaya into the back of Thapelo Morena to give away a silly spot kick that the Zambian referee Janny Sikazwe had no hesitation in awarding.Sundowns had the lion s share of possession thereafter but pushed it around without real chances. But another Langerman cross found Leonard Castro for a 17th minute header that crashed into the net only to be called back by the referee for a push that Morena committed in what looked a tough call on Sundowns.That would have made it 3-0 but instead KCCA got a lifeline and even though Sundowns then kept pushing the ball around they lacked a killer instinct.It took 18 minutes for Sundowns to create their second chance to arrive for Castro again.KCCA had their first chance on the stroke of half-time and then came out a much better outfit in the second half where they pressed better and began to play with some confidence.But they had some good fortune with their 69th minute strike as Anele Ngcongca slipped at the vital moment to allow the cross to come through for Geoffrey Sserunkuma to score a potentially vital away goal.The Ugandan club had caused a shock when last in South Africa in 2009 by eliminating SuperSport United in the early stages of the same competition and, having arrived on Tuesday were determined to pull off another giant killing feat.They might yet do so if Sundowns do not watch out. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
