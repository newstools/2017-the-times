Mroza made history when his track Van Damme emerged victorious as the SABC Summer Song of The Year.Winning the prestigious title earlier this year has catapulted Mroza's career in ways he once dreamed of.Speaking to Drum magazine Mroza explained that he never imagined he would taste such success."It hurt me so much because I knew I did not leave school because I was stupid...I left because I was forced to," he told the publication.Mroza added that as a child he didn't know the use for money because he lived a very rural life in KZN."I always thought that when you wanted food, you ploughed the fields and milked cows. And when you wanted to bath, you would go to the river, even without soap. I didn't know there was any use for money," he added.But just like Mroza sings about in Van Damme - through determination any obstacle can be overcome.Now the star looks forward to celebrating his success and making an even bigger name for himself.To celebrate Van Damme's success and thank fans for the support, Mroza is hosting a free concert in his hometown of Kwa-Hlabisa in KZN this Saturday.
