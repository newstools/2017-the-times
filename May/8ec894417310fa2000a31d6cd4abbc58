Momberg is facing four counts of crimen injuria in the Randburg Magistrate's Court where she is on trial.She is alleged to have called a police officer the k-word during the incident last year. Her utterances were caught on camera.Prosecutor Yusuf Baba asked Momberg if she considered herself a racist.Momberg said she was not racist and that the majority of her clients were black.Baba however pressed her on why she had used the word more than 40 times and why she had specifically asked to be helped by a white coloured or Indian police officer.Momberg said: "At the time I did not want a black person near me."She said she could not remember using the k-word more than 40 times.Momberg had earlier told the court that the video footage and audio which showed her swearing at police officers and a 10111 operator was tampered with."There is some form of tampering with the video."Momberg said she lashed out badly by swearing at the police officers."I was erratic and irritated. Whatever I said I was very angry and fearful. I don't think I really cared. I just wanted help " she said.Momberg said the k-word was derogatory and was not something she would use on a daily basis."I don't agree [with using the K-word]. It's a form of a swear word."I do feel I should apologise but I hope they [the police officers she swore at] understand what I was going through."Momberg said she had received death threats after the incident including one from a sangoma."I received a lot of death threats. People told me there is a truck load of people coming to my house."She said she also got messages from people threatening to rape her.She herself was called the k-word Momberg said."I do understand where it's coming from."- TMG Digital/TimesLIVE
