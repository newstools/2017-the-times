Mayoral Committee Member for Water Xanthea Limberg said that as of Monday dam levels had dropped to an effective 20%.The South African Weather Service forecast a 60% chance of about 5mm of rain falling across the city.The Department of Water and Sanitation lifted water restrictions in Gauteng earlier this week after heavy rains topped up the Integrated Vaal River System made up of 14 dams to approximately 95%.But the water situation in the drought-ravaged Western Cape remains dire.While the rainfall is unlikely to have a significant impact on the water shortage in Cape Town it was welcomed by residents who still have to contend with strict water restrictions.Lesanne Brooke captured the mood in a tweet:Rain in Cape Town! #celebrate #rain #water #waterRestrictionspic.twitter.com/5PoLX5v1TO lesanne brooke (@blissdragon) March 15, 2017Rain in Cape Town! #celebrate #rain #water #waterRestrictionspic.twitter.com/5PoLX5v1TOFinally we have rain in Cape Town.
