It denied Chippa a chance to leap frog over Arrows in the standings but the three-point gap remains with the Durban outfit in seventh place and Chippa eighth.Chippa United might have been 3-0 up at half-time such was the dominance of their performance in the first 45 minutes but in the second half they let their handle of the game go as Arrows fought back in a spirited fashion. We cruised in the second half which was not acceptable and we paid the price, lamented an angry Chippa boss Dan Malesela after the 90 minutes.Although Manzini did get two goals he should have had at least four, missing badly right in front of goal in the 11th minute after a smart build-up.Menzi Masuku was again at the heart of the production line when the goal did arrive five minutes later, skinning two defenders on the right before pulling it back for Manzini to hit home for his fourth goal of the season. Not even the strengthening of the Arrows midfielder with the introduction of Nduduzo Sibiya just past the half hour mark could stem the Chippa show as they passed the ball around with gay abandon and won almost all the duels in the middle of the field.Masuku and Buyani Sali tormented the fullbacks while Thamsanqa Sangweni, back in the side after being suspended for last Sunday s loss at Bloemfontein Celtic, conducted matters in the midfield.Manzini had another good opportunity in the 33rd minute after getting the better of Limbikani Mzava but let the ball get away from him and cluttered into Arrows goalkeeper Nkosingiphile Gumede.In the 40th minute, Andile Mbenyane was too casual when presented with a chance for a goal but lacked urgency and power in his shot.After the break Mbenyane was again denied as Mzava cleared off the line after making a horror error initially that allowed Mbenyane a clear-cut opportunity.Then suddenly Arrows were back in the contest at the end of a quick counter that Lerato Lamola needed no second invitation to take with a powerful strike that rocketed into the back.The equaliser came just after visiting coach Clinton Larsen had made an attacking substitution and suggested Arrows half-time talk would produce some rewards. They moved up their defensive line to make charge of the middle and suddenly take over control. But parity lasted just two minutes with some sloppy defending costing the Durban outfit as Manzini was allowed to head home from close range.Arrows got their second with just six minutes left as the defending was again poor with the Chippa defenders backing off and leaving Lamola with space to hammer home off the underside of the crossbar. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
