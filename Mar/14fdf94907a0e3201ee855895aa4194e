The doctor who asked not to be named had left before the incident but went back to help colleagues immediately afterwards. He said a section of roof measuring about 30 metres by 20 metres collapsed.He didn t feel unsafe about continuing to work at the hospital. "It s a concrete building. It is going nowhere " he said."This is an isolated incident. Waterproofing has been taking place on the roof. The collapse has happened because of stupidity " he said."The old waterproofing was gravel on a roof that was a few metres thick before the collapse " said the doctor "Now they have been redoing the roof they have moved all the gravel to one side. That gravel which normally covers 100 square metres has been piled onto one small side of the roof." The doctor said the recent rain compounding the gravel situation was probably why the roof collapsed. "The collapse is about 50 metres from the street entrance to the hospital on the fifth level. Three people excluding those trapped under the gravel suffered minor injuries. An eyewitness said emergency workers were doing their best to uncover the trapped people. We just heard a loud bang and had I could not believe my eyes. It is clear that there are still people trapped underneath but the rescue team is doing its best to get to them. It s a mess the eyewitness said. A fifteen-year-old girl who didn't want her name used told TimesLIVE she was "lost for words" as the roof collapsed just as she was about to enter the hospital."I was late for my appointment at the dentist. I was about to go in when it happened. In my mind I didn't think the roof would fall. I'm lost for words " she said."All I saw was the roof collapse and then there was a lot of dust. I could just hear people scream and then we came outside " she said."I'm glad I wasn't trapped inside but I still feel really bad for the people trapped inside."[VIDEO] #CharlotteMaxeke roof collapse.
