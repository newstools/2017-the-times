Cricket SA said yesterday the tour would end a bumper 2017-2018 season that could feature as many as 13 Tests.With the Bangladesh and Australia itineraries confirmed, South Africans now await the schedule for India's visit in the first half of the summer. That tour is also expected to feature four Tests. Success against the Australians and Indians holds important implications for South Africa's test ranking.The Australia series starts at Kingsmead on March 1 and ends at the Wanderers on April 18, which coincides with the Easter weekend.That could prove an interesting experiment as the size of crowds for Boxing Day Tests at Kingsmead and St George's Park have disappointed.Should the Wanderers see a better turnout, an argument could be made for moving Tests during holiday periods to the Highveld.
