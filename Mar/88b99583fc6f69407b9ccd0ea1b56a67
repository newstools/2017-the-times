The fire which produced a giant column of smoke that hung over the city razed a large portion of the warehouse.The flames were fuelled by wax and plastics in the warehouse and fanned by strong gusting winds. According to a statement issued by the eThekwini Municipality emergency service personnel had reined in the fire although it was still burning. "The smoke from the fire is moving over the city as a result of strong 40-50km/h southwesterly winds. The smoke is not at this point coming to ground within the city but is moving towards the northern direction. "In the event that members of the community come into contact with the smoke they are advised to stay indoors and close all windows and doors as well as ensure that air-conditioning systems are switched off it reads."South Coast Road has been closed between the M7 and Bayhead Road. Due to the poor visibility emanating from the smoke motorists are advised to keep their headlights on and drive cautiously." Earlier TMG Digital reported that firefighters had been hampered by poor water supply in the area as a result of drought-linked water restrictions.
