"Yes‚ my FB friends‚ my daughter has become just another statistic in this messed up country of ours‚'' Absolon wrote on the social media site. "Where is the justice; so many unanswered questions. Yes‚ I am extremely angry‚ but deep in my heart I know it was God's will‚ and she is in a better place right now. Nicole was the livewire of the family‚ and I am going to miss her tremendously."
