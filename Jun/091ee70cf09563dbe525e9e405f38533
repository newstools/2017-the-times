This after Somizi told Sowetan on Thursday that he was sorry and did not mean to hurt the singer with "bar comments" he made at the SAMAs last weekend. However, speaking to Daily Sun, Zahara said that she did not receive a formal apology from Somizi."I saw something online about him apologising but I still haven t received an apology from him. How is sorry, Zahara, it was just a joke an apology? Seriously?," she said.The singer was left furious by the comments and told the publication that she planned to serve Somizi with a letter of demand today. "I m sending a letter of demand to him from my lawyers today. He has until the end of the week to make a formal apology to me. I m not playing!," she added.Speaking to TshisaLIVE earlier this week Zahara made it clear that she did not care if Somizi's comment was a joke."I don't care if he was joking. At whose expense was the joke? This will hurt my image and could impact whether I get sponsorship deals or not. It is not funny and I want him to apologise," she said.Zahara explained that she was out of the country during the SAMAs but her mother heard the comments and told her about it."Imagine how upset my mother must have been to hear that. It is not true and it was not right for Somizi to make comments like that. He should have been talking about my accolades and all the SAMAs I had won in the past, not nonsense," she added.Somizi told audiences at the glitzy awards ceremony on Saturday night that there was a bar at the after party and "Zahara would be there".
