The 45-year-old man arrived in King Williams Town in the Eastern Cape on Sunday. This morning we woke up to the arrival of my brother in his black Adidas track-pants and a green and blue jersey. He is so happy he can t stop talking " said his sister Nosiphiwo Shiyani.She identified him after TimesLIVE published a photograph of him living inside the wall. The family searched frantically for him after being under the impression that he had gone to Grahamstown and disappeared."He is clean and looks healthy. My family and I are happy that he is home and I will immediately take him to the local clinic for his medication. The first thing he asked for was Morvite said Shiyani.He has been living in a cranny for the past two months ever since arriving in Johannesburg."I miss home especially waking up to Morvite Weetbix and Jungle Oats for breakfast. I miss my mother and my two sisters who I left behind when I took a bus to the city " he told TimesLIVE earlier.
