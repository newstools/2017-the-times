There was a power failure which caused the delay.#AbsaPremThe power failure not only affected the stadium, but the surrounding area in the East Rand township.It is not the first power failure to affect a professional game this season with notable matches being the Kaizer Chiefs v Maritzburg United Telkom Knockout Cup match at the FNB Stadium last year and the Mamelodi Sundowns v Chippa United clash at Loftus Versfeld.While the former fixture continued and went to penalties after power was restored through a generator, the latter had to be completed the next day in the form of a "two-day" game that ended goalless.The #AbsaPrem Log Standings after this evening's matches. pic.twitter.com/g4ome7oVFj Official PSL (@OfficialPSL) May 10, 2017The #AbsaPrem Log Standings after this evening's matches. pic.twitter.com/g4ome7oVFj - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
