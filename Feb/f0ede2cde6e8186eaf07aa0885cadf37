The e-mail has sent shockwaves through the Port Elizabeth Muslim community after it was uploaded to Facebook last week. It seems that Muslim[s] love to push their religion on the western world and expect us to tolerate and accept this but it is about time that we as western[ers] stand up and say enough is enough it reads. If they want their so-called centre then they must have it [in] their own country. While the e-mail was sent from Hazel Kendrickc s NMMU account on Monday last week she claims it was hacked. I am very distressed about this Kendrick said yesterday. My e-mail has been hacked and apologies to anyone for the inconvenience. Kendrick works at the university s chemistry department.It seems the e-mail stems from an application by the Westering Jamaat Khana which received permission from the municipality to gather and pray at a house in Boshoff Street.The application was approved by mayor Athol Trollip during a mayoral committee meeting in October.But the decision is being reviewed after objections were received.A screen grab of the e-mail that was circulated online has the full name of the sender but the receiver had been blacked out.- TMG Digital/HeraldLIVE
