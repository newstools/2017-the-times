Former US First Lady Michelle Obama had the world jealous with her incredibly toned arms. Don't for a second think she's about to stop the workouts now that she isn't in the public eye as much. Obama posted a picture of herself doing a plank and said that she used to host bootcamps while she was in the White House. "I've continued this tradition and wanted to share some photos. My girlfriends have been there for me through all kinds of life transitions over the years – including a pretty big one recently! – and we’ve done our best to stay healthy together." But guys. Can our crush get even bigger?
