Highly-placed sources within the SABC have told TshisaLIVE that Bonang's resignation had everything to do with co-hosting the show with Lerato. Apparently SABC bosses communicated the news to her, and Bonang was not happy about having a co-host, but said she would give it a shot. After much criticism from fans and realising that the proposed format wouldn't work Bonang handed in her resignation. SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago confirmed Bonang's resignation but would not be drawn into commenting on the claims. When asked about whether Bonang's resignation was a shock and a loss, all he would say was, obviously. "Bonang was on the schedule, she started her show this morning with her co-host," he said. Bonang's resignation with immediate effect comes in the wake of major reshuffle at Metro FM. After more than a decade on 5FM DJ Fresh was moved to the Metro FM breakfast show, and was joined by Somizi as his co-host. Unathi Msengana also resigned from the station on Friday last week, and Glen Lewis left the station after 22 years earlier this month.
