Stellenbosch make the short journey to Cape Town side Milano United on Wednesday in their penultimate match of the campaign before a home clash against already relegated Santos on Sunday.Milano are fighting to save themselves from the drop as well giving them plenty of reasons to put up a stern fight. Stellenbosch are third on the NFD table and two wins will see them into the play-offs.They are on 46 points with Black Leopards just ahead of them in second with 47.But behind those two are a clutch of clubs waiting to pounce with Royal Eagles AmaZulu and Witbank Spurs all on 44 points. We can t afford to slip-up in the derby against Milano who have their own reasons for wanting to win the game Troughton told Times Media Digital. We have just finalised our preparations and we have made the players very aware it is a must-win and where the pitfalls are. It s nice that we still have the ball in our court and we don t want to lose that advantage going into the final game of the season on Sunday."We have to be careful to make sure we play well. Santos may be already relegated but I have a feeling they are not just going to come here and roll out the red carpet for us."They could be saying goodbye to some players and that will not make it easy."It s why we must keep winning against Milano. Stellenbosch have been dealt a blow with the news that former AmaZulu and Lamontville Golden Arrows defender Sibusiso Hadebe has a dislocated shoulder and is out.But the club from the Cape Winelands have plenty more players with experience to see them through including veteran striker Mame Niang Manti Mekoa David Booysen and goalkeeper Washington Arubi. With the experience we have on the pitch and in the technical team we feel we are well prepared for the game against Milano but time will tell.
