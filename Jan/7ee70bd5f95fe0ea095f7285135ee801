Bolani claimed that her services were used by the ANC during the elections and demanded R2.2-million in payment. The application was dismissed.Shaka took to Twitter only hours after the claims surfaces to deny the reports, calling them "fake news". He later released a statement calling the reports inherently false exaggerated and no doubt intended to discredit in part my reputation and most significantly the name of the ANC .
