The 24-year-old Mpumalanga beauty departed for Manila in the Philippines yesterday where she will compete against 80 others.Kunene said she was not afraid."The Miss SA and Miss World stages were great ways of preparing for this pageant, which is the one I have wanted the most since winning Miss South Africa, because it's bigger and bolder."I've prepared my walk which is key for this pageant and have practised saying 'South Africa', because we have to announce ourselves and I wouldn't want to not be heard once I'm on stage."Kunene arrived at OR Tambo International Airport yesterday afternoon with her parents, Baby and Christopher Kunene, and her sister, Nelisiwe in tow.Kunene offered a sneak peek at her national costume designed by Quiteria and George."Her national costume showcases South Africa's cultural heritage and diversity while detailing her Swazi heritage," said Sun International stylist Noreen Kajee Vareta, who is styling Kunene's 18-day trip.Sun International owns the Miss SA pageant."It's difficult to combine all aspects of South Africa but the designers tried their best and added glitz so the garment has show and stage value," said Kajee Vareta. Kunene will participate in various judged challenges before the finale in Manila on January 30.The contest will be hosted by US comedian Steve Harvey and plus-size model Ashley Graham, and will see reigning Miss Universe and Filipina beauty queen Pia Wurtzbach crown her successor.
