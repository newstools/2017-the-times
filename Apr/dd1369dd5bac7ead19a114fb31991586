Mosimane has now made clear that there is no rush to get the big Ugandan back in goal. We keep saying next week but the goalkeeper coach says no . We need to have a fit Onyango for the matches that are remaining now " Mosimane said."I m happy there is no more Nedbank Cup for us and the African Champions League is still some way off so maybe he can have a little bit of a breather. I don t think we should rush him (back). Our form at the moment has nothing to do with our goalkeepers. They are not being forced to make big saves they are on holiday."Even when we played (Kaizer) Chiefs there was no direct threat. We play on one side of the pitch our goalkeepers are on the other. So there is no need to rush Denis unless we get all emotional. The problem is not there it s on the other side of the pitch."So Denis can rest a littler bit longer he s got a busy programme coming in May and June Mosimane said in the build-up to Thursday s crunch derby match with SuperSport United. Sundowns' first-choice goalkeeper has not played since coming off early with a knee injury against Bidvest Wits at the end of February. Kennedy Mweene and Wayne Sandilands have both been playing in goal for Sundowns since.The club have the best defensive record in the top flight this season with just 11 goals conceded. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
