DA caucus leader Zwakele Mncwango said on Monday afternoon that Gumede unlawfully appointed Sithole without the support of the council as is required by law.Mncwango said in terms of Section 56A of the Local Government Systems Act (2000) the Municipal Council must appoint the acting deputy city manager (DCM) under circumstances and for a period as prescribed . The DA has demanded that the appointment of Mr Sithole be set aside as unlawful and that the matter be brought again before the council he said.However Gumede s spokesman Mthunzi Gumede accused the DA of sleeping on the job as the decision to appoint Sithole was taken at a meeting in which they walked out.Gumede announced in December that deputy city manager of human resources Dumsile Nene would be acting as municipal manager following the unceremonious departure of then manager Sibusiso Sithole.The two Sitholes are not related.Mthunzi also no relation to mayor Gumede said: That decision was taken at the last council meeting from which the DA walked out. They actually slept on the job. Dumsile is still the acting municipal manager. Please note that the city is also expediting the process of filling all vacancies said Mthunzi.Philip Sithole is acting DCM for economic development.However Mncwango said he would request that the council sanction mayor Gumede and request that an explanation for this misconduct be tabled before the assembly as soon as possible. This follows Mayor Gumede s similarly unlawful suspension of the former municipal manager Sbu Sithole which had to be reversed following the DA s intervention. It is becoming increasingly clear that the mayor is simply not up to the job of governing eThekwini. If she is incapable of abiding by the laws of South Africa then she should step aside. Our people demand effective leadership so that we can create jobs and deliver better services. The DA will continue to make sure that this happens. TMG Digital/The Times
