Sports presenter Robert Marawa had a 44th birthday to remember, after his missus Pearl Thusi decided to gather his close friends and family for a surprise party.How cute?We didn't make the guest list but luckily someone at the party recorded the surprise and Robert shared it with his fans on Instagram.The video shows guests, including musician Zakes Bantwini, waiting in anticipation before a blindfolded Robert is led into the party by Pearl.A post shared by Robert Marawa (@robert_marawa) on Mar 7, 2017 at 6:56am PST A post shared by Robert Marawa (@robert_marawa) on Mar 7, 2017 at 6:56am PSTOur favourite part?Well, besides the shocked look on Robert's face, the hug Pearl's daughter Thando gave Robert melted our heart and gave us life. #BirthdayGoalsForDays
