Nquthu Municipality the only one in the country that still does not have office bearers no mayor deputy or speaker - has been dissolved by the KwaZulu-Natal provincial government.Fresh elections are to be conducted within three months by the Independent Electoral Commission the KZN department of co-operative governance announced on Monday.The area includes the well-known international tourist destination Isandlwana which was the site of the historic Anglo-Zulu war battle which took place on 22 January 1879 when an estimated 22 000 Zulu warriors under Ntshingwayo kaMahole Khoza.defeated a contingent of some 1 350 British and native troops. The battle remains the single greatest defeat for the British Army at the hands of a native army.Cogta MEC Nomsa Dube-Ncube said there was no way the litigation process brought by a number of councillors would be finalised soon.Since August 3 local government elections last year the municipality has attempted seven times to sit and elect its council with each meeting either ending in political chaos or litigation.At least four councillors separately applied to be reinstated by their political parties after being withdrawn or went to court to have any council meeting nullified.The municipality first attempted to sit on August 10 but the meeting descended into chaos.The last attempt was last week Tuesday where both ANC and IFP supporters tried to force their way inside the Pietermaritzburg City Hall where the chaotic meeting to try and elect office bearers was being held.The meeting had been moved from Nquthu due to safety issues.All litigations were still pending at the time of dissolution and will no longer apply.Last month the portfolio committee on Cogta after conducting its oversight became the first to unanimously resolve that the cabinet consider the dissolution of Nquthu Municipality. Despite the committee of the legislature making this far-reaching resolution the Executive still made efforts to get the councillors to elect office bearers. It also changed the venue for meetings.All 33 councillors will lose their seats and an administrator will take over the running of the troubled municipality.The decision was approved by the cabinet last week but is still awaiting the endorsement by the National Council of Provinces and the minister of Cogta Des van Rooyen."The truth is that the people of Nquthu are tired of witnessing the endless political theatre that has rendered their municipality dysfunctional when it comes to efficient administration sound financial management good governance and effective service delivery " Dube-Ncube said. Like all dramas the Nquthu story has been shocking dramatic and upsetting and today we take a strong stance to end the protracted political stalemate she said of the extra-ordinary decision. This was not a decision that we took lightly being fully cognisant of its far-reaching consequences. But we are confident that this was the right decision and one that will ultimately restore the credibility. We also hope that by dissolving this council we are sending a strong message to other municipalities in the province where political infighting threatens local governance she said.Political parties have yet to react on Dube-Ncube s decision.The majority IFP was expected to govern the council.The party has 15 seats to the ANC's 14 while the NFP has two and the EFF and DA have one seat apiece.The IFP needed the EFF and the DA to edge out an ANC/NFP coalition.-TMG Digital/TimesLIVE
