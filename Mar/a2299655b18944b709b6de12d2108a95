When ER24 paramedics arrived on the scene they found one person in the back of the car and another person lying a few metres from the car. As the paramedics prepared to transport the man they found on the ground to hospital his heart rate dropped significantly and he had to be resuscitated. After about 20 minutes of resuscitation nothing more could be done for the man and he was declared dead on the scene said ER24 spokesperson Annine Dormehl.She said two other people who were in a critical condition were transported to nearby hospitals in the area by other emergency services. It was not clear what caused the car to roll and local authorities were on the scene for further investigations.
