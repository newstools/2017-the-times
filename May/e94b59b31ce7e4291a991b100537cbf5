Speaking to Gareth Cliff on CliffCentral, Unathi said that she had always felt a close connection to her ancestors and revealed that the feeling had gotten stronger over the last few years.This strong sense of duty has led to the Idols judge travelling home to the Eastern Cape at least twice a year to perform traditional rituals."There's a spiritual calling there. I have already become more traditional. It is in the universe, I have already become more aware of the journey that I have to take," she said.She revealed that her ancestors have been calling her and she could not run from her calling."I have had to accept more responsibilities, spiritually, and that is part of the journey. It is a beautiful journey and one that I have to embark on. They (the ancestors) have been calling and I know the responsibilities. It is a journey that gets deeper and stronger as I get older," she said.However, Unathi believed that she will only be called on to fulfill her calling once her children are older."I know that my calling will only fully develop in my third phase of womanhood," she added..
