Just hours after it was revealed that Lerato had teamed up with Bonang Matheba to co-host the show, she resigned. In the wake of the major shakeup at Metro FM, social media has been abuzz, with split views on Lerato taking over the hot seat. But Lerato has no time for negativity, and took over the reins with her held up high. In fact Lerato says she's emotionally strong and nothing fazed her. For many years I've been bashed by black woman on twitter for GROWING and taking brave steps! Nothing new! Im emotionally strong! https://t.co/jOkjKLcWyBIt's sad that for many years I've received so much hatred from Black Women! https://t.co/3TOrMeXXoY
