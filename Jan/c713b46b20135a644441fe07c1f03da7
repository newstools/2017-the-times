This follows the leak of a provisional report by public protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane that recommended that Absa repay R2.25-billion to the fiscus for an apartheid-era Reserve Bank bailout for Bankorp, now Absa.Malema spoke during a media briefing following an EFF leadership plenum at the weekend."The Absa nonsense is not legit and I will not be told by opposition of the EFF how to act"We will hold Absa accountable through our own terms and at our own time. The people calling for the occupation of Absa and pay back the money are on the Gupta payroll," he said.Malema pointed out that the EFF had said long ago it would "occupy" Absa."We are not going to occupy Absa through the terms of our enemies. We said we will not announce the date and time, so why are you so impatient?"We will not announce it and Absa will just wake up and find one day red berets all over it."Malema used the opportunity to lash out at the public protector, despite the fact his party approved her appointment last year."We are playing the role of the public protector better than Busi Mkhwebane," he said.He also told reporters the EFF aimed to unseat the ANC in by-elections."We will be participating in all ward by-elections with the sole aim of removing the ruling party from the government," Malema said.
