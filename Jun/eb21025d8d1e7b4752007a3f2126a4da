The kwaito musician told TshisaLIVE that he laughed along with masses when the "broke" reports surfaced yet again this past weekend. Sunday Sun reported that Msawawa had allegedly moved back home to stay with his father in Cleremont, KZN after his sugar mama apparently showed him the door.The publication claimed that the "broke" rumours resurfaced when the musician became a laughing stock after a local comedian joked that he can't even afford "half brown" (half a loaf of brown bread)."I just laughed at that article, I cracked up when I saw it. Flymotion is a comedian so I know it was a joke, and besides I am doing well," he said.Msawawa told TshisaLIVE that he had dozens of pictures and video's to prove that he's far from broke.
