City returned to training on Friday after their festive season break and Tinkler admits there were some players who might have done better with their fitness programmes during their downtime.But he says the excitement and energy is there and that the club hopes to replace the likes of Australian midfielder Matt Sim and Latvian defender Renars Rode in this transfer window. Some of the players came back in good shape others not so much Tinkler told TMG Digital. The first day is always a difficult one and we put them on a long run which some players handled better than others. But they are all raring to go and I think very excited for the second half of the season. As for trialists Tinkler was giving nothing away except to confirm there would be players training with the team next week. We do have certain guys coming in to potentially fill some holes but I would prefer not to mention any names now. They should all be arriving next week. Tinkler also confirms that the surprise decision to part ways with Sim was very much the Australian s side. He started very well and was playing extremely well before he got an injury which kept him out for three weeks. In that time the team was performing well and the players who came in to replace him were excellent. So he struggled to get back into the starting line-up and because of that decided he wanted to leave. It was definitely a decision that came from his side. City are joint top of the Absa Premiership table having played 15 matches this season and also claimed the Telkom Knockout title in December.They resume their league campaign with a home meeting against Highlands Park on February 7.TMG Digital/TMG Sport
