That s according to the Democratic Alliance which said on Sunday it supported all moves to crack down on abusive market conduct. The DA regards collusion in an extremely serious light as it shortchanges and harms the consumer and serves to perpetuate economic injustice said DA spokesman on economic development Michael Cardo.He said the Competition Tribunal would have to determine whether the absolute level of the rand was manipulated and the exact nature and extent of the harm done to consumers.Ultimately it was the consumers for whom justice must be served. Against this backdrop the DA rejects the populist bandwagoning of the ANC Minister Mosebenzi Zwane and a whole assortment of captured Gupta-groupies who are using the matter to drive their own personal crusade against the banks. The Competition Tribunal must be allowed to test the evidence and adjudicate accordingly free from political interference Cardo said.
