This is contained in the party s memorandum of grievances handed over to the local police management after a protest march on Friday.The area has been marred by internecine political violence between the SACP and the ANC for more than a year.Provincial deputy secretary Matthews Ndlovu said that since January 24 last year we have witnessed the burning down of houses the killing and injuring of our people because of political differences political factional tendencies and power mongering".He said about 12 people have been killed in the Inchanga area and at least six people sustained gunshot wounds.Despite having been beaten battered and murdered the SACP said it still wants to be in the alliance with the ANC and to mend their differences.Local branch secretary Nkosinathi Mkhize told TimesLIVE that talks between them and the ANC have never taken place.He said the ANC only sent a representative to hear their grievances and the killings continued unabatedly. Only police can stop this now hence our march this morning said Mkhize.Among other leaders who joined the march were KwaZulu-Natal SACP chair and former eThekwini mayor James Nxumalo and Ndlovu who handed the memorandum over. Councillor Malombo Nxumalo an independent candidate led the march for more policing.The SACP said their main gripe was with law enforcement agencies and the police.Among the demands were that a permanent police station be built. There is a dedicated police station site identified more than 10 years ago at Intshangwe [Inchanga] said Ndlovu. We the community of Ward 4 and Intshangwe in particular demand that we should be guaranteed a safe environment free of criminals who are murdering and maiming our community members he said.KwaZulu-Natal police spokesman Captain Nqobile Gwala said the provincial management of the South African Police Services had not received the memorandum.The full list of grievances are: A permanent deployment of extra police on our streets and passages until the situation has stabilised.We demand that the criminals who have been involved in the murders of our people be arrested and this must happen speedily.We demand that the police must ensure that all the witnesses associated with these cases are protected as two witnesses have been killed already.We demand that a temporary police station be put up at IntshangweWe demand that a permanent police station be built at Intshangwe. In any event there is a dedicated police station site identified more than 10 years ago at Intshangwe.In light of the above demands we therefore demand a response within seven (7) days from the South African Police Services failing which we will be forced to call on government to deploy the Defence Force in the area as we are now losing trust in the SAPS.However we have felt that we need to give them an opportunity to either correct the situation and or continue to fail the Intshangwe community.We also call the people of Intshangwe to refuse to be used against one another for narrow political interests and ambitions and we further call upon the people of Inshangwe to legally defend themselves when they are being attacked.
