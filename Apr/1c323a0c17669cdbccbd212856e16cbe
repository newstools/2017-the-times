Browde said she joined the picket to protest against what President Jacob Zuma backed by the Gupta family were doing to South Africa."If the president does not go our country will go further and further downhill. Already we are seeing the damage he has done " said Browde.She worked with grassroots organisations and said that she could see what more could be done with the money Zuma and the Gupta family had taken for themselves without thinking about the people of the country.She said there was tremendous potential in the country's people who have had no opportunities poor education and were not being served by the current crop of African National Congress leadership.She said that she belonged to the ANC of Mandela and Sisulu "whose mission in life was to see South Africa being proud of the country the people call the rainbow nation".She said the morality and the vision of the old ANC had gone."What we are trying to do is get enough people in the ANC to say: 'Enough is enough'. It is time for President Zuma to go and allow people (in) who have values to bring the ANC back to its original vision " said Browde.
