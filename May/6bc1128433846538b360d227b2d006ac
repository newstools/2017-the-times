However KwaZulu-Natal Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs spokesman Lennox Mabaso said there were no major flooding incidents reported. Nothing major except localised flooding particularly in Mzingwenya in Richards Bay but we are managing the situation. We have evacuated some people near Mzingwenya as a preventative measure he said.Earlier this year the Mzingwenya stream burst its banks forcing residents in the low-lying Dube Village to evacuate their homes.Mabaso urged drivers to exercise caution as many road were water-logged because of bad weather.TMG Digital/TimesLIVE
