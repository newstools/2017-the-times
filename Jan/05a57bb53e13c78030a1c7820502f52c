Star s African adventure starts with a tricky clash against little-known Mozambican side Uni o Desportiva do Songo on the weekend of 10 to 12 February.By then Johnson's charges would have played one league match against Orlando Pirates at home. We are going to Africa which is not easy if you don t have the right type of players in the squad " he said."You have to know exactly what you are doing."You have to give young players a chance to play at that level but at the same time you must be careful and avoid being embarrassed."Johnson who coached at this level while with Stars and Mamelodi Sundowns in the past added that the experience of senior players like Vuyo Mere Robert Ng ambi Ndumiso Mabena Tinstwalo Tshabalala and Solomon Mathe is going to be key as they look to impress. If we don t get what we are looking for on the transfer market I will still be content with having a number of players like Vuyo Mere and Robert Ng ambi who have experienced the tough conditions or travelling and playing on the continent he said.Stars general manager Senzo Mazingisa said the club will do everything in their power to procure quality players within the team s limited budget. We cannot act like we have got big budgets and it is for that reason we promoted youngsters who were ready to be promoted " Mazingisa said."We had to tighten our budget because the economic environment is clearly not favouring us."I know we are not alone in that boat anything we do we have to be cognizant of the budget. He said that it was also important for his players and of other teams that will be going to feature on continental competitions to have a mental shift and embrace the challenges of these competitions. Our players must be strong mentally to deal with whatever they come across on the continent and do whatever it takes to succeed there."Sometimes I feel that our players don t value the opportunities of playing on the continent and being professional athletes. - TMG Digital
