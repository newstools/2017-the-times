Creator Marc Hardwick speaking at the launch in Durban on Wednesday said the Guardian Schools app gives children a safe and instant portal to report contentious issues.Schools that sign up for the app at a monthly fee of R500 designate a team of staff members to receive the faceless reports with any pupil who downloads the app able to report abuse or malfeasance. When a report is submitted it will arrive as an e-mail to the predefined staff members informing them to log in to the system to access the details of the report and take the necessary action to safeguard the child said Hardwick. The staff members have the ability to request further information from the reporter but will never know their identity. This is extremely important to us as the power of the app is ensuring the anonymity of the reporter he added.Once the school investigates the matter they can choose to refer the matter to the police. We believe that this application will not only help children to report abuse and get the help and support they need timeously but will make sure the perpetrators are brought to book. We see it as a proactive tool in the fight against these kinds of crimes which often go unreported as children are too afraid to speak up he said.Hardwick said that the need for an abuse reporting portal had been underscored by the Parktown Boys High School scandal in which over 20 pupils were allegedly sexually abused by a water polo coach. If the school had had the app there is a possibility that the kids could have made a disclosure about what was happening to them and the abuse may not have been so widespread he said.A pilot version of the app was launched late last year.On its website the organisation states that it works with a host of schools including Kearsney College Michael Mount Waldorf Michaelhouse Midrand Montessori Redhill School Roedean School and Sacred Heart College.- TMG Digital/TimesLIVE
