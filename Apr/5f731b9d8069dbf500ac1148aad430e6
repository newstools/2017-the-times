In a statement issued on Saturday morning, deputy minister Bongani Mkongi said he was angered by what had happened, describing the suspects as "heavily armed lunatics". According to reports, the gang stormed the SA National Defence Force base in Khayelitsha, overpowering guards and taking their rifles off them."We will not sleep. We will hunt these criminals like wild dogs chasing after them. We will find them and make sure they rot in jail like all other hardened criminals who tried and failed to undermine the state and the people of the Republic," said Mkongi.
