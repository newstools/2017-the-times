A flash flood is a rapid flooding of a low-lying area. A massive storm caused this type of dangerous flooding – claiming at least one life – in and around Durban on Tuesday. ER24 has published a checklist of precautions that should be taken in a flash flood. Firstly‚ people living in areas that are prone to flooding should plan ahead to protect family and property. Precautions to take at home: Should you be outdoors or in your vehicle‚ do the following: “Keep an eye out for weather warnings‚ radio announcements and news articles. Only trust warnings from verified sources and do not distribute warnings circulating on WhatsApp and other social media channels that cannot be verified. These warnings cause unnecessary panic and may cause further harm‚” said a statement issued by ER24 spokesman Werner Vermaak.
