President Jacob Zuma was bestowed that dubious honour recently when Time Magazine compiled a list of five world leaders less popular with its citizens than the embattled American president.South Africans with a penchant for dark comedy will be heartened to see Zuma making the cut with Time pegging his approval rating at an all-time low of 20 percent in the seven major metropolitan areas. More eye-popping is the number of South Africans who want him to resign: an astounding 70 percent.While the article lists the country s slumping economy as part of the reason for the low approval ratings it also points to the man himself as the biggest cause. But it s Zuma himself who s the bigger problem the article reads listing the nearly 800 charges of corruption against him his patronage networks and the expelling of well-respected ministers as part of myriad reasons to account for only one in five urban South Africans supporting the president. Zuma s term runs through 2019 for most South Africans change can t come soon enough the article concludes.The other four listed include Michele Temer of Brazil Venezuela s Nicolas Maduro Najib Razak of Malaysia and Alexis Tsipras of Greece.South Africans might be comforted that at least Zuma hasn t overseen crises on the scale of some of the above leaders: Maduro endures daily violent protests and inflation of over 800 percent last year while at the same time defanging the national legislature.Temer may find himself the second Brazilian president in a row to be impeached after recordings emerged linking him to the far-reaching Lavo Jato graft scandal. Brazil is also in its worst recession after two consecutive years of the GDP contracting more than seven percent.
