This follows an article in the Sunday Times this weekend which alleged that Prasa acting CEO Collins Letsoalo had given himself a more than 300% salary increase to put him on par with former CEO Lucky Montana. When he left Prasa Montana s package totalled R5.9 million. The union said Letsoalo clarified at a press briefing on Monday that the salary package was duly approved by the board of Prasa. "More worrying for us however is the turnover rate of CEOs under the current board."There have been three CEOs so far and yet the circumstances at the rail agency continue to deteriorate. Under the guidance of the current board Prasa is all but bankrupt " the union charged."Managerial targets are not met and there has been a spike in train delays and avoidable accidents. Take for instance the latest incident where two trains running on one line collided injuring more than 100 people."Unfortunately the losers in this situation are the poorest of the poor whose dream of a safe reliable affordable and integrated public transport system is still deferred."SATAWU said it was "gravely concerned" about its members job security if nothing is done to ensure that Prasa is sustainable."Sanity must prevail and therefore Prasa must be returned to a state where it can operate optimally. The revitalisation of the trains and rail infrastructure must be put back on track. For these reasons SATAWU will seek a meeting with the shareholder the Minister of Transport Dipuo Peters."
