Mzansi was introduced to businessman Musa Mseleku's large family of four wives and 10 children (and their 15 cars) and Twitter immediately declared it a favouraite.Uthando Ne Sthembu debuted on Thursday on Mzansi Magic and the 30 minute show already had people requesting that it be extended to an hour and moved to Sunday, where it would join other favorites such as Date My Family and Our Perfect Wedding.The show looks at the pros and cons of polygamy, but the major lesson for most tweeps was that money played a huge part in maintaining the joy in the family. Twitter was impressed.So its official guys let's work hard and make money and marry lots of women and build houses for them and buy cars neh! #UthandoNesthembu#Uthandonesthembu Musa's exes who dumped him for cheating be looking at his wives like...."that would've been me" pic.twitter.com/HvcJCM8Acl#uThandoNesthembu when you wake up and see the guy is still trending...... pic.twitter.com/BUR5tVAyE2Wow guys.I can't wait for these no good fcvkers 2 tell lecture us on how monogamy ain't natural...heyi heeyi..what what.. #UthandoNesthembu pic.twitter.com/TCI0yQ2VWmGood morning to Bab' Mseleku and my future sister wives..... #uthandonesthembu pic.twitter.com/fORWGQJNtHRetweeted Galeboe (@GeeMolema): Each wife has two cars #Uthandonesthembu pic.twitter.com/DDTup6sBMY https://t.co/Ve6IlskvtjThe kids all have drivers, the wives all have two cars each, Yoh, guys did you see all the cars parked the levels #UthandoNesthembu#UthandoNesthembu so its not allowed to be broke and have polygamy? pic.twitter.com/Wzhlzq5el4
