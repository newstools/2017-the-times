City s continued charge for the championship in the new club s first season is reaching Leicester City-esque proportions.But in Wits who are shaping up for their best chance at a first PSL title in their 96-year history City might face their stiffest obstacle.Wits can afford to lose.But if Gavin Hunt s team can come back from the Cape with a point or more they will set themselves up for an eight-match run-in to the end where the title will be within sight.Eric Tinkler s City can afford to lose far less.On 45 points from 23 games the Citizens have played two matches more than third-placed Wits (44 points) and fourth-placed defending champions Mamelodi Sundowns (41).For Wits even if a win will not significantly dent their title chances there is everything to play for.Hunt s team can go a long way towards eliminating a now serious title chaser in City with a victory while also keeping a small buffer between themselves and Downs who they meet in three matches' time on May 1 at at Bidvest Stadium.Things are heating up at the top of the PSL and nowhere more so on Wednesday night than at Cape Town Stadium. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
