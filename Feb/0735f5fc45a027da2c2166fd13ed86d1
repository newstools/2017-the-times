It was a chillingly efficient performance where the hosts were clearly galvanised by Phakamani Mahlambi's superb showing. The rest of the team also covered itself in glory in what was a profitable night for the Clever Boys. SuperSport United will have the chance to remove Gavin Hunt's side from the summit when they face Golden Arrows in Atteridgeville on Wednesday evening but the healthy goal difference Wits have accrued for themselves cannot go unnoticed.Mahlambi picked up where he left off in 2016 with a hand in both first half goals. He was the recipient of some generous Ajax defending in the 20th minute, with his right-footed shot from just outside the box going past Jody February's outstretched left hand. While he didn't quite get around Bafana Bafana defender Rivaldo Coetzee, the corner he forced led to Wits' second goal through Thulani Hlatshwayo. The towering defender powered a strong header past the helpless February from an excellent Mogakolodi Ngele corner.Ngele should have scored a third in the 43rd minute but decided shoot straight at an Ajax defender with only February to beat after Mahlambi evaded Thabo Mosadi's attentions.Such was the strain on Ajax's defence, Lawrence Lartey and Coetzee both received cautions from the normally overzealous Victor Gomes.The former also had the indignity of being taken off before half-time as coach Stanley Menzo saw fit to end the torture. Ajax rarely threatened and when they did, the rock solid defensive pairing of Buhle Mkhwanazi regularly snuffed out the danger.Ajax's best chances came through Tashreeq Morris in the 14th and 17th minute, with the latter chance bringing the best out of Darren Keet after a rare defensive lapse from the hosts.Things got messy from the visitors when the normally reliable February fumbled a pass, which allowed Hellings Gabadinho Mhango to put the hosts three up just before the hour mark.Whatever fight was left in the Urban Warriors departed at that point, from where the returning James Keene nodded in S'Fiso Hlanti's delightful cross three minutes later.Menzo was left fuming in his beige suit and whenever the resident band went quiet, his expletives were audible around the small stadium.He had every reason to be besides himself with anger. Wits didn't have to work exceptionally hard for their goals and when the visitors had chances, like they did in the 47th minute, they didn't know how to convert them.Morris and Ndiviwe Mdabuka dallied over who should take the shot with the Wits defence in sixes and sevens.Mhango added a second one in the 78th minute to bring up the golden five, underlining Wits' dominance and Ajax's ineptitude.Mhango could have made it six in the 88th minute when he was the beneficiary of another Ajax defensive lapse. However, February pulled off the save of the game save his team from further embarrassment. - TMG Digital
