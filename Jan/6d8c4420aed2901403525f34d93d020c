Dolly was taken to the Premier Soccer League s dispute resolution chamber (DRC) by Sundowns after he received an offer of around R14-million from Olympiacos then later a little more from Montpellier which surpassed an amount of R12-milllion in the player s contractual buyout clause.Sundowns asserted that the R12-million figure was a mistake made when an initial 2014 contract which stipulated a European buyout sum of R25 million was amended in 2015. The DRC ruled in Sundowns favour.TMG Sport is reliably informed that Dolly s representative will now appeal the DRC s finding at arbitration with Safa. TMG Digital
