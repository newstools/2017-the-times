Mo T credited his weight loss to eating right, training and drinking lots of water. His followers gushed at the difference between his then and now picture and encouraged the musician to post more snaps.He shared in his caption that he only started seeing results after he made up his mind to compete with no one but himself."The 1st pic on the left goes back to when I started training, but then I changed my method of training and eating habits to get the results on the picture on the right. So I promised myself that I would only compete with myself and Never Give Up to achieve the body of my dreams and I am still going strong," he wrote.
