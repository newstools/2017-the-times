Directing traffic South African style! Classic :)The video captured by motorist Murray Kernick on Saturday shows the Johannesburg Metro Police Officer throwing down some smooth moves while directing traffic at the intersection of Cedar and Witkoppen Roads in Fourways. I was wondering what song she was listening to? Kernick told TimesLIVE on Sunday. It must have been a great song. But I was also thinking that she was being awesome. Kernick uploaded the video to Facebook on Saturday afternoon. By Monday morning it had been shared 4 336 times and viewed over 175 000 times.
