Wits were tardy and committed numerous basic errors, also having Sifiso Myeni sent off in the 79th minute, conceding goals for Stars by Makhehlene Makhaula (24th minute), Mohammed Anas (65th) and Sinethemba Jantjie (90). Cuthbert Malajila had pulled one back for Wits in the 76th.The Clever Boys coming into the game with a three-point lead over Mamelodi Sundowns capitulated again at the ground where they just cannot seem to win.Had Downs not conceded a late goal in their 2-2 draw against Baroka FC at Lucas Moripe Stadium the Brazilians would have drawn level with Wits on 57 points at the top.As it was, Gain Hunt's team enjoyed something of a let-off in the title race, preserving a two-point lead despite a woeful performance at a Goble Park ground where they have now not won in six meetings against Stars.Stars veteran captain and defensive midfield stalwart Paulus Masehe led the physical onslaught in the middle that rattled Wits on their bogey ground. The win earned Serame Letsoaka s side three points that moved them to 26 points in 13th place, in a bitter fight against relegation.From the first half on a Goble pitch not in its worst condition of patchiness, but still far from pristine, Wits allowed themselves to get bogged down.Against a hard-working, determined Stars who needed the points as much as their visitors did, if not more, Hunt s team got themselves into a tangle.They could not string much together in passes. After an uneventful opening 23 minutes, Stars scored with a goal from nowhere, their pressing game resulting in the opener.Stars won the ball in Wits half, allowing Makhaula to jink down the middle and produce a shot that never rose above three feet but had the power to beat Moeneeb Josephs inside the goalkeeper's left upright.In the 59th Wits lively forward Maliele Pule s cross curved onto the crossbar.Wits sloppiness continued conceding Stars second. Phumlani Ntshangase was caught in possession to allow Sifiso Mbhele to run through and beat Josephs, but not the upright. Mohamed Anas finished the rebound into an open goal.Wits pulled one back when Phakamani Mahlambi won the ball in the area with his back to goal and found Malajila free on the left, who finished low past Thela NgobeniBut to compound a miserable evening the red for Wits substitute Myeni for tugging on Anas from referee Victor Gomes was unbelievably soft.It seemed it could not get worse for Wits, but it did. Ngobeni s kick out of his area found Jantjie on the break, who played a one-two with Makhaula to be free on the left and finish low past Josephs.- TMG Digital/TMG Sport
