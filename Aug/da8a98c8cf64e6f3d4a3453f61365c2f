Ntando Duma is evidently winning at this life game. Just two months after giving birth to her daughter, Sbahle, Ntando can already wear a teeny-tiny bikini. While the rest of us are still trying to work off all those winter soups, Ntando's body is summer ready. The actress, who recently enjoyed some down time, shared pictures of her on the beach in Durban. This is what you call #bodygoals!
