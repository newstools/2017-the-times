Goals from Romelu Lukaku and Kevin Mirallas put Everton in control at Goodison Park.Teenager Tom Davies scored a fine first goal for Everton in the closing stages and debutant Ademola Lookman completed the rout after coming on as an 89th minute substitute.It was another chastening experience for City boss Guardiola, who wasn t used to such humiliation in his trophy-laden spells at Barcelona and Bayern Munich.The defeat was City s fourth in their last eight league games and left them 10 points behind leaders Chelsea.Publicly at least, Guardiola wasn t angry with his expensively assembled team and he insisted the chastening afternoon could have gone differently if City had taken their early chances. We created enough chances in the first half to score. After what happened we were not able to score and Everton had one chance and scored, Guardiola said. They scored straight after half-time and that is tough mentally for the players. But the Spaniard did concede City look destined not to win the title in his first season in England. The first one, yeah, said Guardiola when asked if top spot is now out of the question. The first one is a 10-point gap and that is a lot of course.
