 AfriForum has already received complaints from Afrikaans schools who are under this pressure in this regard and is willing to assist schools with advice the group s education coordinator Carien Bloem said as the 2017 academic year started. The Department of Basic Education plays political games with schools language policies names and emblems that must be changed which has great cost implications while there is a more urgent need for more schools especially schools that can provide education to learners in their mother tongue."She blamed the lack of space in schools on an incompetent education department which neglects to monitor the population growth and movements in the country . Many parents in Gauteng for example have experienced problems with the online registration platform which also attributed to many learners not being registered at schools said Bloem. Learners who have not been placed in schools will have to wait up to a month to get feedback from the department on whether they possibly have placement in a school. TMG Digital
