The ANC's policy discussion on economic transformation, which formed part of the discussion documents released to the public yesterday, does not call for the expropriation of land without compensation.Instead, the document proposes that the government should do away with paying "premium" prices when purchasing land for reform and proposes "just and equitable" compensation.The party's attitude to land reform approach is expected to be a hotly contested topic at the ANC's policy conference, set to take place in June.Zuma's backers have adopted radical economic transformation as their campaign theme in a bid to deliver former AU Commission chairman Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma to the highest office.The divisions are likely to play out at the policy conference in Johannesburg when Zuma's supporters are expected to push that land expropriation without compensation be adopted as ANC - and therefore government - policy. Zuma recently broke ranks with his party's caucus in parliament when he suggested ANC MPs should have voted in favour of an EFF motion to amend section 25 of the constitution to allow for the expropriation of land without compensation.In January the Sunday Times reported that Zuma told an ANC policy workshop that the party's policy proposals were not radical enough and ordered that the documents be rewritten.Enoch Godongwana, head of the ANC NEC's subcommittee on economic transformation, which drafted the document, admitted that his party was divided on the matter."People have got different viewpoints on these matters. Obviously, there is going to be contestation," he said yesterday.
