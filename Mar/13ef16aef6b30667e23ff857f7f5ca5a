That is why some in his cabinet, such as Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini, appear to be untouchable, say political analysts.Dlamini has been criticised for the way she handled the social grants payments fiasco. But the analysts say she is secure in her position as long as the ANC Women's League, of which she is president, backs Zuma's preferred successor for the presidency, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. "She is someone who will be able to survive under almost any type of condition," said Dirk Kotze, a Unisa professor.Susan Booysen, of the Wits School of Governance, said: "Dlamini is in a relatively powerful position because she promotes Nkosazana for the presidency.""She can really do anything she wants, or needn't do anything. She probably knows she is going to get away with it."Analysts Dumisani Hlophe and Moeletsi Mbeki agreed. Mbeki, however, said there was an added dimension: "Zuma wants to show the country that he can fight against the Constitutional Court."
