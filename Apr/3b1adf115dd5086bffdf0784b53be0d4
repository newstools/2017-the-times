The amaBhungane Centre for Investigative Journalism on Friday named them as the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and Centre for Renewable and Sustainable Energy Studies (CRSES) at Stellenbosch University.The CSIR fell silent after a secrecy-shrouded meeting earlier this year between acting Eskom CEO Matshela Koko and his counterpart at the CSIR Dr Thulani Dlamini.Correspondence seen by amaBhungane revealed that the CRSES withdrew criticism of Eskom s nuclear plans submitted for publication so as not to put at risk their significant funding from Eskom.Democratic Alliance MP Natasha Mazzone said in a statement on Friday that Eskom should be urgently summoned to appear before Parliament to account for allegations that it had paid off anti-nuclear research groups .Eskom the CSIR and CRSES have denied that the parastatal attempted to muzzle the debate on nuclear and renewable energy.
