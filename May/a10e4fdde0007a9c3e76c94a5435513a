Zahara was left fuming over "bar comments" Somizi made at the glitzy awards ceremony on Saturday night and even threatened to sue him.Speaking to Sowetan about the debacle that has hogged headlines Somizi said he meant no harm."I only mentioned bar and her name, not alcohol. But if that offended her I am sorry. I did not mean to hurt or harm her. It was just a joke," he said.Somgaga added that he poked fun at many local celebs and even called Khanyi Mbau white.However, speaking to TshisaLIVE on Tuesday, Zahara was spitting fire and did not care that it was a joke."I don't care if he was joking. At whose expense was the joke? This will hurt my image and could impact whether I get sponsorship deals or not," she said.
