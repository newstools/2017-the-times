Dozens of DA supporters are protesting outside the high court in Cape Town in support of the party s bid to urgently interdict the swearing in of 15 ministers and deputy ministers.In a statement the party dismissed the new ministers as compromised and co-opted individuals .James Selfe the DA s chairman of the federal executive said his party wants the swearing in postponed until President Jacob Zuma s decision is reviewed or the motion of no confidence against him is debated in parliament. The decision is profoundly irrational in the first instance said Selfe. It is probably illegal in the second instance.Zuma s decision to fire Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and replace him with Malusi Gigaba has drawn particular criticism. But more than anything it is cataclysmic for the South African economy and for its people there is going to be untold potential harm in the form of a possible downgrade by rating agencies. It is just bad bad. Selfe added: The decision is so profoundly irrational bearing in mind what happened the last time when there was a Cabinet reshuffle to the value of the rand. I do believe that is in South Africa s interest that this interdict be granted. Protesters who braved the cold sang: Zuma s father rides a baboon Zuma s father is a witch.
