The agency had been given until 4pm on Monday to answer the court s questions but seems to have missed the deadline. Officials at the Constitutional Court s Registrar s Office confirmed at close of business yesterday they had not received paper filings in response to the court s request.Attempts to get clarity from the Office of the Chief Justice and Sassa were unsuccessful.Last week the Constitutional Court asked the agency to explain why it would not be able to take over the payment of grants as it had promised the court it would do. The court also wanted to know who was responsible and who in Sassa knew and when they knew it could not manage to take over grant payments come April 1. The existing contract concludes at the end of March and the agency is negotiating a deal to extend the contract with CPS outside of a normal tender process.Instead of meeting its 4 pm deadline to give 17 answers explaining what led to the current situation Sassa appears to have filed papers in response to a different court case brought by NGOs Black Sash and Freedom Under Law.In this case due to be heard on Wednesday the NGOs have asked the Constitutional Court to supervise any new deal Sassa makes to ensure the paying of grants.The agency has agreed to these requests and even proposed a draft order the court could make giving it authority to supervise any interim contract for grant payments. Sassa has said it does not oppose Black Sash's request and has offered to give quarterly reports on how it will ensure payments of grants in future. It suggested the auditor general or public protector help the court supervise Sassa plans to ensure social grants are paidCPS also filed papers on Monday saying it had no problem with being supervised by the court should it enter into a new contract with the agency.CPS told the court it does not want to be involved in the long-term payment of grants saying the controversy the court cases and the uncertainity over who would take over in April had damaged its reputation. It however said it would not leave Sassa unable to pay grants in April and could help in a interim arrangement with grant payments.But Sassa has opposed Freedom Under Law's requests to get involved with specifics of the contract with CPS.Sassa says it does not want the court to determine the price and length of contract it has with CPS in future and says the court does not have jurisdiction to get involved in such detail. - TMG Digital
