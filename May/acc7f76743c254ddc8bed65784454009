 Many women fear joining Pantsula because they believe it s hard and impossible to do. But here we are doing it so it s not hard. Sometimes we go for auditions and the panellists would tell us that they want male dancers. Being a woman disadvantages me even though I can dance better than some of the male dancers said Lenela.According to Lenela her gender can be a barrier to opportunities but she is determined to continue with her passion for dancing in a platform that does not necessary accommodate them.Her advice to women is that they should not set limits to their dreams but give it a try adding that with passion and dedication one can do anything they set their mind to do.Pantsula is a syncopated quick-stepping and low to the ground form of dance which evokes the urban street culture of which it is a part. It is predominantly practised and performed by groups in the townships of SA.
