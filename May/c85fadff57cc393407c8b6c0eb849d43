But with the Absa Premiership title within touching distance for the Clever Boys, the three-time league winning coach believes that this could be their time to return with all three points from Goble Park.Wits visit hoodoo team Free State Stars tomorrow at the summit of the league, three points ahead of Mamelodi Sundowns with three games to go.But Ea Lla Koto have a habit of dashing Hunt's dreams. They eliminated Wits from the Telkom Knockout this season and that was the fourth successive time that Free State Stars had dumped Wits out of a knockout competition with Hunt in charge.Wits have not won in Bethlehem in four years."It has never been kind to us, but maybe it is our time now. We will go there with a positive frame of mind. They are a hard side to play against there," Hunt said."They are fighting for their lives and we are fighting on the other side of the table. We are under no illusion what to expect there. I have been going there for 35 years; I know what it's like."It's no wonder then that Hunt hinted that the club would not release Reeve Frosler and Phakamani Mahlambi to the national Under-20 team going to the World Cup in South Korea.Amajita leave for Korea tomorrow, the same day that Bidvest Wits take on Stars."What do you think?" was Hunt's response.He said the final decision rested with management."We have a big game on Wednesday and another big game next week (against Polokwane City)," Hunt said."We have three big games coming up. It's in our hands. But we have to be careful. We have to enjoy it. That's the most important thing."I have been in these situations [before]. If you don't enjoy it, it becomes a grind. We know that we have three huge games," the Wits coach added.
