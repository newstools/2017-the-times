 It s so great to hear it was worth it. I m glad I jumped said Ryan Botha a fitness instructor and model.The Australian tourist fell eight meters when he tried to take a selfie at a New Year s party at a Camps Bay house. Botha heroically jumped to his rescue despite being urged not to.The man who is in his late 20s is in ICU conscious and in a stable condition. Botha described the recovery as miraculous .The two men are recovering at Christiaan Barnard hospital in Cape Town but have not been able to meet. Botha s broken leg has left him bed-ridden but he s hoping to regain enough mobility by next week to visit. I want to meet him for my own healing process. I keep hearing the sound of him choking on his blood. Botha has already met with the man s parents who thanked him for his heroic efforts. When we met there was an immediate warmth between us. He said the love and support he has received has been overwhelming as messages on social media have streamed in.However Botha said acknowledgement for his actions was the last thing on his mind as he leaped (quite literally) to the man's aid. I was one of two guys who knew how to do CPR. People around me were saying you will hurt yourself. But I said 'I have to jump someone has to'. I heard my leg break as I landed. It was awful. Botha managed to crawl to the man who he found choking. He administered CPR and stayed with him until emergency services arrived.He insists that the incident was not a result of negligence and drunkenness and was a simply a freak accident at a laid-back get-together. - TMG Digital/The Times
