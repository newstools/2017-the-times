As South Africans fumed, his proposal appeared to find little support among legislators who gave it short shrift yesterday when he floated it at parliament's portfolio committee on communications.But Aguma's proposal is not entirely without international precedent. For example, TV Licensing in the UK, responsible for collecting fees there, levies fines for those streaming programmes on their mobile devices without licences.Households with existing television licences are covered, though, for streaming on other devices. Users of the BBC's iPlayer streaming service were initially exempt from requiring television licences but that was changed last year.Other countries, such as Romania, do exactly what Aguma proposes. There, if you don't own a television but do own a computer at home, you still need a licence.There might be a little more sympathy for Aguma's pitch and the SABC's dilemma if it wasn't so roundly despised and for the fact that the revenue problem that it faces is largely of its own making.Thanks to Hlaudi Motsoeneng's "90% local content" policy, audiences have fled the SABC's key commercial radio and television channels followed by a drop of more than R200-million in advertising.Now taxpayers are being asked to dig the broadcaster out of its hole with Aguma's expanded licensing proposal which, besides being utterly unenforceable, is politically unpalatable in these straitened times.The tragedy is that the SABC, once it is being run properly, needs a new funding model and all options should be looked at - including the levying of, for example, an additional utility tax as is the case elsewhere.
