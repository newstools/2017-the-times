In his judgment yesterday, Mabuse said the then minister acted irrationally when she dissolved the board without giving it a fair hearing.He set aside Peters' decision and ordered the board's reinstatement with immediate effect. He also set aside the appointment of the interim board."The minister exercised her powers arbitrarily or in a greatly unreasonable manner by not giving the members a hearing and simply removing directors of the board."A denial of a fair hearing was clearly designed to cause these concerned directors substantial prejudice," Mabuse found.The court noted that Peters' failure to give reasons for her decision to dissolve the board when requested by the board to do so created the presumption that her decision was irrational."The minister's explanation of her conduct quite clearly is internally inconsistent and irrational. She terminated on the one hand [former Prasa acting group chief executive Collins] Letsoalo's secondment to Prasa, thereby tacitly confirming that there were sound grounds for such termination."... by doing so, the minister validated the action of the board to terminate Letsoalo's secondment appointment at Prasa ..." Mabuse said.The court reprimanded Peters for accepting Letsoalo's version that a dispute had arisenbetween him and the board, resulting in his axing, and for using the "dispute" as a "springboard to remove the former board"."These two cannot be married with each other. They demonstrate that the decision to remove the board was irrational," Mabuse found.Peters' decision to remove the directors was, he said, "so unreasonable and disproportionate as to be arbitrary and irrational"."The board took a decision to terminate Letsoalo's appointment after it had sought and obtained legal advice."The decision to terminate Letsoalo's appointment was thus plainly reasonable given the fact that [the board] had discretion to terminate his appointment at will."Peters should have accepted the board's decision to terminate Letsoalo's secondment and not disciplined it, Mabuse ruled."Her decision was accordingly unreasonable on that basis alone."The board was dissolved following the removal of Letsoalo, who was axed in February after reports that he gave himself a 350% salary increase.Popo Molefe, who was chairman of the Prasa board, claimed he had not been told of the board's dissolution by Peters.
