Mail and Guardian deputy editor Beauregard Tromp dismissed rumours that the newspaper's offices were raided saying two police officer's acted "cordially" and "professionally" when they asked to speak to the editor."It was absolutely cordial. There was nothing threatening and no invasion of our space in any way or form. They were very professional " he said.The newspaper reported on Thursday that the police officers proceeded to ask for a statement from journalist Phillip de Wet on the source of a "leaked" draft report by former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela on the Absa/Bankorp matter.The Mail and Guardian reported on the interim report from the Public Protector in January. The draft report recommended that Absa repay the fiscus an amount of R2.25 billion for an unlawful bailout during apartheid.Incoming public protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane laid criminal charges at the Brooklyn police station in Pretoria in January."The public protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has suggested that she was taking action against the actual leak " Tromp said."But we argued that the public protector (Madonsela) has actually stated previously that she put the report out there to the public. So as far as we are concerned it s a public document and as far as our reporting of it there is overwhelming public interest and it s a necessary story for us to publish " he said."We've come under criticism not only from private quarters but from certain sections of the government and then even from within our own fraternity suggesting we are trying to manipulate the news agenda for some or other grouping. To my mind I rubbish those claims. Ours is not try and exact some outcome ours is to report without fear or favour. We are not here to bat for any team " Tromp said.Tromp said they informed the police officers that they would cooperate after speaking to their lawyers."What we said is we're happy to cooperate with the police as far as we are compelled to as the media within our own ethics and the law we would cooperate. We see no problem with that " he said.Mahlatse Gallens Chairperson for the South African National Editor's Forum said: "We wish to reiterate that the confidentiality of sources is not only sacrosanct but the cornerstone of the ability of whistle-blowers to expose corruption and other malfeasance in the public interest."We have noted that the Mail &amp; Guardian will seek legal advice on the matter and SANEF will support the newspaper should the need arise " she said.
