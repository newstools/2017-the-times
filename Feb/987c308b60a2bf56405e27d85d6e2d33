Hundreds of fans gathered to remember the musician at his memorial held in Worcester, Western Cape over the weekend.But even though he was an award-winning musician, Sunday World claims Lundi was evicted from his home and had to borrow money from a friend to pay for storage.Lundi was living with his manager, Anele Hlazo, at the time of his death.Family and friends told TshisaLIVE on the day he died that they expected rumours of Lundi being broke to emerge as "that's standard gossip in the black community when someone passes."They were quick to rubbish the claims, insisting that everyone had problems but Lundi being broke was not one of them.
