There is no doubt that the performances have been disappointing overall but there are positives to draw from here and there."This is a young team that continues to learn and grow together after losing influential batsman in the last while and we have to be patient with them he said. There have been areas like fielding where we did not exert ourselves well such as fielding and shot selection but they will learn from those mistakes and move forward."We must also take into consideration the pitches that we played on at the three venues ...... they were not ideal for them. We saw in Port Elizabeth Cape Town and here that there was a lot of grass on the wicket. With the limited overs following after this Test Arnold said he hoped that the Sri Lankans will improve their performances even though they have not been particularly impressive in T20 s and ODIs in recent times. Hopefully we will see different pitches and the team will show improved performances he said.Dean Elgar was South Africa s best batsman of the series with 308 runs from his five innings and he was followed by JP Duminy with 273 Quinton de Kock with 270 Hashim Amla with 231 and Stephen Cook with 216 in the top five.Kagiso Rabada was the pick of the bowlers with 19 wickets and he was followed by Vernon Philander with 17 Keshav Maharaj with seven Wayne Parnell with six and debutant Duanne Olivier returned with five. - TMG Digital
