This is according to doctor and entrepreneur Daniel Kraft, who works in medical inventions, transplant medicine and stem-cell technology at Stanford University in the US.An example of how apps are changing is Upright Pose, a new app-linked device from Israel.It is a small white device you wear on your back. A sensor detects when you are slouching and the device vibrates.The vibration is not painful, but is annoying enough to make you stand correctly, says the company's business manager, Ori Fruhauf.Upright Pose is working with Siemens and Nespresso to improve their employees' posture and decrease chronic back pain.The company is considering bringing it to South Africa and has been in talks with local companies.Its appeal is that it is a simple device that prompts an almost immediate response.Kraft said the device was like a "Jewish mother telling you to stand up properly"."We are moving from wearables to insideables," he said.Devices will now be implanted in the human body and deliver medication in response to measured pain.There will also be breathables: devices that manage your blood alcohol level and lock you out of your car if you've had too much to drink.Katharine Child's trip to Israel was sponsored by the Israel Export Institute.
