Kohli, who remarked before the series that he was "really good friends" with some Australian players, said things had changed during the bitter contest between the world's top two sides."I thought that was the case but it has changed for sure. As I said in the heat of the battle, you want to be competitive but, yeah, I have been proven wrong. You won't hear me say that ever again."The 28-year-old skipper caused a furore in the second Test when he accused counterpart Steven Smith of repeatedly abusing the decision review system.Critics questioned Kohli's conduct under pressure, and also his form in the series, in which he scored just 46 runs in five innings.Tensions worsened when the Indian captain was dubbed "the Donald Trump of sport" in an Australian newspaper, and former Test bowler Geoff Lawson said he acted like "your worst behaved player".The rancour between the sides was inflamed in the drawn third Test in Ranchi when Glenn Maxwell was pictured mocking Kohli's shoulder injury.The animosity then spilt over into the series-decider when spinner Ravindra Jadeja and Aussie wicketkeeper Matthew Wade indulged in a verbal exchange overheard on the stump microphone.The Board of Control for Cricket in India posted footage of the incident, complete with stump microphone recordings, on its website and social media channels.India's Murali Vijay then found himself at the centre of a fresh controversy after claiming a catch that replays showed had spilt onto the grass.TV footage caught Smith fuming angrily in the dressing room and appearing to say that Vijay was a "f****** cheat"."I have been pretty intense throughout this series. I really wanted to do well for the team. At times I have been in my own bubble and have let my emotions slip. I apologise for that," said Smith."I was a bit disappointed that the BCCI sieved through the archive to find a conversation out on the field between Matty (Wade) and Jadeja."What is said on the field should stay on the field."
