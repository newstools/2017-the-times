Rantie failed to pitch up for a World Cup qualifier against Burkina Faso in Ouagadougou reportedly giving Bafana team manager Barney Kujane the runaround.The Genclerbirligi striker was recalled to new coach Stuart Baxter s first Bafana squad this week for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Nigeria in Uyo on June 10.The South African Football Association had said at the time of Rantie going Awol for the match under previous Bafana coach Shakes Mashaba that the striker would be charged and penalised.However it appears the striker is set to escape with merely a slap on the wrist.Safa communications manager Dominic Chimhavi said on Friday: It was not really that nothing materialised (of Safa's disciplinary sanctions). What happened was that Rantie was never called for a camp. Bare in mind the only time we can penalise a player is when he is in camp. Because the players don t belong to Safa. Players belong to their clubs. So what right do we have to discipline a player when they are not called for camp? Asked if Rantie will still face disciplinary measure now he has been called up or have the benefit of a clean slate now that Bafana have a new coach Chimhavi said: No look what we agreed is that we just need to revisit the issue. But we also don t want to destabilise the camp. So it won t be a punishment per se. But just to revisit what happened and express that we don t expect it to happen again. Rantie has been recalled having been earning regular game time after a transfer from English Championship team Bournemouth to Genclerbirligi.- TMG Digital/TMG Sport
