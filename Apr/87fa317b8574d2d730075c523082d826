"The sense from the investors is that we need to explain in detail what we mean by radical economic transformation," he said. The government did not want to create "a disjuncture between growth and development", he added.Speaking to local investors at the Development Bank of Southern Africa, Gigaba said the Treasury would soon unveil plans to deal with the Standard &amp; Poor's and Fitch downgrades.He said though he was aware of the impact of the rating downgrade, "inclusive growth" was still the government's priority."We fully appreciate the gravity of the downgrades, the significance of what they mean to the economy and business and to South Africans," he said.Gigaba said that, before the downgrades, green shoots in the economy were apparent: higher business confidence, lower inflation and a reduced deficit.The priority was still to achieve inclusive economic growth and governance of state-owned entities was paramount.Regarding the country's nuclear programme, Gigaba said it would occur only "at a pace and scale South Africa can afford".The Treasury was committed to fiscal consolidation plans outlined in the 2017 budget, he said, adding that it aimed at stabilising the government's net debt over the next three years at 50% of GDP."To accomplish this we are controlling expenditure tightly," Gigaba said.
