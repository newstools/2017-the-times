When that story was published, Qaanitah Hunter, the reporter who wrote the story, was vilified and numerous attempts were made to rubbish it and her journalistic ability.Parliament's statement vindicates Hunter and the story.What should also not come as a surprise is the total disregard of the ANC for public sentiment.Molefe, once celebrated as having turned an ailing Eskom around, left the parastatal after being accused by Public Protector Thuli Madonsela in her state capture report of favouring the politically-connected Gupta family. The family is in business with President Jacob Zuma's son, Duduzane, supplying coal to Eskom.There are at least two other reports that show that all was not as it seemed at the power utility.But, instead of dealing with the contents of Madonsela's report, the ANC, through Zuma, intends taking her findings on judicial review.Instead of interrogating the Dentons report to ensure that Molefe is untainted by the allegations it makes, the ANC jumps the gun by putting him forward as an MP.At the weekend, long-time ANC member Mathews Phosa bemoaned the state of his beloved organisation, headed by a "president who had been found not to have honoured his constitutional oath of office" and who had "only laughter to offer when members of parliament were treated to PW Botha-style unconstitutional assault".He said he had experienced "a Damascus moment" and could no longer keep quiet.There might come a time when the ANC as a whole has a Damascus moment, but if it continues to ignore public sentiment on major issues it might come too late.
