The service degenerated into chaos when fired finance minister Pravin Gordhan, who was the keynote speaker, and ANC treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize, were booed and their speeches were drowned out by league supporters singing pro-Zuma songs.ANCYL provincial secretary Thanduxolo Sabelo said that once the footage was received the investigation would not take more than a month.On the penalties that could be imposed on transgressors found to be ANCYL members, Sabelo said: "It depends on how the accused plead and whether they plead guilty and show remorse for their action but I can't pre-empt that process."The Active Citizens Movement, the organiser of the memorial service, are considering legal action against ANCYL for defying a High Court order prohibiting its members from harassing or intimidating anyone who attended or spoke at the service.The NGO sought an interdict on Saturday to prevent the ANCYL from disrupting the service.Judge Rashid Vahed said he could not prevent anyone from attending the event but he ordered that ANCYL members not disrupt it ."The Active Citizens Movement is considering legal advice on how to address the contempt of court and is consulting its members on the way forward," said Yashica Padia, adding that the movement was disappointed by the conduct of the ANCYL.Mkhize said that the behaviour of the ANCYL members was unacceptable and eroded respect for the ANC."It is clear that the ANC leadership has a huge task to embark on political education to teach our youth tolerance of different views," said Mkhize.ANC provincial spokesman Mdumiseni Ntuli said the party would "engage with" the youth league on the disruptions at the memorial service "which we consider to be unfortunate and regrettable".
