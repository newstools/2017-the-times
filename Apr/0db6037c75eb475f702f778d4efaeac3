DA finance spokesman David Maynier said the bill was one of the most important legislative weapons in the fight against corruption in South Africa.It provides for the ongoing monitoring of the business relationships sources of wealth and sources of funds of domestic prominent influential persons and family members and close associates of domestic prominent influential persons in South Africa. What this means is that President Jacob Zuma and his most important clients the Guptas are going to feel the heat as their business relationships sources of wealth and sources of funds are subjected to ongoing monitoring by financial institutions in South Africa Maynier asserted.However he said the battle was from over and that there could still be significant delays in implementing the legislation because despite being signed into law by Zuma the legislation only actually commences on a date to be determined by the minister and published in the Government Gazette.The Financial Intelligence Centre must for example still produce an official list of domestic prominent influential persons and of family members and known close associates of domestic prominent influential persons . This will be a massive task because the list of domestic prominent influential persons includes for example senior executives as well as family members and close associates of senior executives of all companies supplying goods and services above a threshold amount which must be determined by the minister and published in the Government Gazette. There are also doubts about whether the Financial Intelligence Centre which only has a budget of R289 million for 2017/18 will have the resources to effectively implement the Financial Intelligence Centre Amendment Bill Maynier said.The minister would no doubt be under political pressure to delay the implementation of the legislation to protect his political master s most important clients the Guptas Maynier added. The minister should therefore take decisive action and set out clear timeframes and budgets for the implementation of the Financial Intelligence Centre Amendment Bill. Whatever the case we will have to very carefully monitor the implementation of the Financial Intelligence Centre Amendment Bill. And I will therefore be requesting the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Finance Yunus Carrim to schedule a meeting to probe the readiness of the Financial Intelligence Centre to implement the Financial Intelligence Centre Amendment Bill in South Africa Maynier said.
