Despite being a singing sensation, Winnie said that she would never forget her roots. "When I look at this picture, I always become humble because indeed God wants only what is best for everyone. Behind my younger brothers Themba, Neo and Mandla I see the shark that taught me the spirt of Ubuntu. That is our humble beginning," she said. Winnie added that it was very difficult for her to pretend that she was from somewhere else. "Today it becomes very difficult for me to act as if I was born and raised in some certain environment where one becomes untouchable. I will never forget where I come from. And Love, humbleness and respect will always be the order of the day," she added. A post shared by Winnie Mashaba (@winnie_mashaba) on Mar 7, 2017 at 11:58pm PST
