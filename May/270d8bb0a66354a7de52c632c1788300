That was the word from rugby s governing body on Monday which named Newlands as the venue but with a TBC (To Be Confirmed) pencilled alongside.The October 7 Test against the World Champions could move to the Cape Town Stadium in Greenpoint which hosts the local leg of the World Sevens Series if the certificate is not forthcoming by June.Newlands and Cape Town last hosted the All Blacks in 2008 and if the regulations aren t met in time it could be another long wait to see New Zealand at the venue again. I do not think there will be a problem but if there is we'll have to move the Test elsewhere SA Rugby president Mark Alexander told Rapport earlier this month. It's legislation in the country. If you do not have it (the certificate) we cannot stage a Test there. They have a deadline - the Test is in October and they have to meet that deadline. Newlands has been able to host Super Rugby matches because there is a grace period in terms of implementing the new regulations.But if they don t have the clearance by June then SA Rugby would insist on moving the Test. The Stormers July home Super Rugby quarterfinal could also be in doubt. WP Rugby is proactively engaging with SA Rugby on this matter to resolve all outstanding issues with respect to the new certificates needed according to the new safety at sports and recreational events regulations 2017 Act. WP Rugby Union chief executive Paul Zacks told Times Media Group.Newlands has been a happy hunting ground for the All Blacks. They have won six of nine previous clashes against the Boks at the venue.The Springboks will also head to Bloemfontein for the first time since 2010 to take on Australia in the Rugby Championship.The first match of the Rugby Championship will take place on Saturday 19 August at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth when Argentina clash with the Boks.The following week the Springboks will be in action in Argentina against Los Pumas (Saturday 26 August in Salta) where after it s the first bye weekend.The Boks traditional tour to Australasia is in early September for matches against the Wallabies (Saturday 9 September NIB Stadium in Perth) and All Blacks (Saturday 16 September QBE Stadium in Albany).Although the Springboks have played in Perth before they have never been in action at NIB Stadium home ground of the Western Force.The match in Albany will be the South Africans third visit to QBE Stadium after they played two matches in the 2011 Rugby World Cup against Samoa and Namibia at this stadium which is used as secondary home base by the Blues.A second bye weekend follows the tour before the Springboks head home for their last two encounters on Saturday 30 September against Australia at the Toyota Stadium in Bloemfontein and Saturday 7 October against New Zealand at in Cape Town. The venue in Cape Town is dependent on the outcome of an application for a safety certificate in relation to the first choice venue Newlands SA Rugby said in a statement.Springbok Rugby Championship fixtures:19 August Springboks v Argentina Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium Port Elizabeth 26 August Argentina v Springboks Estadio Padre Ernesto Martearena Salta 9 September Australia v Springboks NIB Stadium Perth 16 September New Zealand v Springboks QBE Stadium Albany 30 September Springboks v Australia Toyota Stadium Bloemfontein 7 October Springboks v New Zealand DHL Newlands (TBC) Cape Town - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
