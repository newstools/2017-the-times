 A planned bilateral meeting between Cosatu and the ANC that was supposed to take place today has been postponed due to the unavailability of some COSATU national office bearers. This was communicated to the ANC and we shall await the ANC to propose a new date for the next meeting. Media reports that the federation boycotted or walked out of the meeting are untrue. The federation is still looking forward to the planned alliance political council meeting that will hopefully assist the alliance out of the current political gridlock Cosatu said in a statement on MondayThe statement comes after speculation about why the meeting scheduled for Monday could not take place. The relationship between the ANC and Cosatu reached an all-time low in 2017.After President Jacob Zuma s cabinet reshuffle Cosatu asked for him to step down. For the first time Zuma was booed and not allowed to speak during a May Day rally a move showing disapproval of the president.The federation has openly declared its support of Cyril Ramaphosa to succeed Zuma as ANC president at the organisation s elective conference in December. Cosatu has also banned Zuma from speaking at any of its events.Monday s meeting was expected to address the widening difference in opinions between Cosatu and the ANC.
