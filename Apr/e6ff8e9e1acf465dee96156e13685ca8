This comes after Zuma filed responding papers in which he opposes the granting of a secret ballot. Zuma has opened a way for the EFF because we reject and despise the self-centred and selfish way in which he wants to dictate how MPs should express their confidence or none-thereof in him said EFF spokesman Mbuyiseni Ndlozi.The EFF said when Zuma opposed the court application he declared war against the freedom the EFF believed a secret ballot sought to protect.The EFF has accused Zuma of wanting to hold on to power at all costs. Zuma who represents a different organ of the state the executive should have allowed parliament to resolve its internal processes with the guidance of the courts about how to handle a motion of no confidence in him as a president said Ndlozi.
