And with their rivals at the bottom of the table starting to find form it cannot be ruled out.Pirates are a giant of the domestic game but currently sit three points above the relegation play-off position albeit with a game in hand. They are without a league victory since November a run of 12 matches.By contrast teams below them - bottom club Baroka FC are unbeaten in four matches and did not concede in three of those - second from bottom Highlands Park have won two of their last three games and 13th-place Free State Stars have two wins including one against Pirates and a draw from their last three.Given the quality in their squad you would think Pirates would find form soon but commentators have been saying that for the last few months and the 3-2 loss to Free State Stars this past weekend again laid bare their frailties.If many Buccaneers fans believe it is unthinkable their side will go down those with longer memories will know they have come very close in the past.For four seasons between 1984 and 1987 Pirates were essentially a lower-half team scrapping among the relegation potentials and on one occasion barely surviving.The 1985 season was one of despair; they won only five games out of 34 and ended just a single point above the relegation zone. Instead it was Benoni United and Cape Town Spurs who went down.Pirates have only four wins in the league so far this campaign and the second-worst defence with 33 goals conceded even the much-maligned Baroka FC have shipped less than that and they have played a game more.Certainly coach Kjell Jonevret is taking the threat of relegation seriously and says he has spoken to the players about it."You always have to take things like that seriously " Jonevret told reporters after the 3-2 loss to Stars last weekend."There are a lot of clubs who don't think they can and they don't believe it until they are there."So you have to take care and you have to think seriously about such things all the time. "And this month could be crucial in either engineering Pirates safety or dropping the club into deeper trouble.They face an improved Maritzburg United at home on April 11 before a trip to Highlands Park four days later.After the break for the Nedbank Cup quarterfinals Pirates host Baroka in another vital fixture on April 26 and then days later another struggling side in Chippa United (April 29).Two wins from those matches would be like gold whereas a failure to claim a victory would be potentially disastrous.Thereafter they have two games in three days against teams vying for the Absa Premiership title BidVest Wits at home and Mamelodi Sundowns away.They close their season with away trips to Bloemfontein Celtic and Lamontville Golden Arrows (on the final day) on either side of a home game with another side who may need a win desperately struggling Ajax Cape Town.- TMG Digital/TMG Sport
