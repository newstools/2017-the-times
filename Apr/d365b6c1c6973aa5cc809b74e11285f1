Twitter wasted no time in taking aim at Lerato, who has for the longest time been compared to Bonang Matheba, who she was supposed to co-host the show with. Social media users even started a hashtag called #BonangLite as a way to poke fun at Lerato. But Lerato took it all with her head held high. Speaking to Pearl Modiadie and Amon Mokoena on Metro FM's The Great Escape, Lerato said that she is in a good space. "Positive and negative. But right now in my life, the way I'm so content, I focus on the positive," she said. Lerato added that she felt like she was being used as an example to other women in similar situations. "A lot of women, even the ones in the industry - some of the actresses, some are deejaying - come to me and they're like 'you actually helped me get over the fear of doing what I've always wanted to do. You stepped up, you said I'm gonna do this thing, the whole country shook again, and look at you'," she said. Lerato added that she was doing everything she loves and didn't care about the commentary.
