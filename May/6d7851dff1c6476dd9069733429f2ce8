Molefe will reportedly be as Eskom's chief executive of Eskom on Monday just months after stepping down in the aftermath of a furore over his links to the Gupta family.His return was sparked by a dispute over a reported R30 million pension payment that he was awarded after he announced in November that he was stepping down in the interest of good corporate governance. The Sunday Times revealed that he was awarded the hefty golden handshake despite only being at the power utility for only 18 months.As you would expect, the memes soon began to surface as South Africa made its feelings about Molefe's return painfully clear:Celebrations tonight at #SaxonwoldShebeen as their Platinum Loyalty Card customer #BrianMolefe returns from a holiday in Parliament. #ESKOM pic.twitter.com/uapUXxZe3QWhat happened, did #BrianMolefe weep crocodile tears again? #Eskom pic.twitter.com/V6xYIsYMjy Jones Mzizi (@jonesmzizi) May 12, 2017What happened, did #BrianMolefe weep crocodile tears again? #Eskom pic.twitter.com/V6xYIsYMjyIvan Glassenberg upon hearing #Molefe was reappointed at Eskom pic.twitter.com/E9QSWMOM5b Mabunang (@ComradeSwirri) May 12, 2017Ivan Glassenberg upon hearing #Molefe was reappointed at Eskom pic.twitter.com/E9QSWMOM5b#Sanxonworldshebeen regulars after hearing the reappointment of #BrianMolefe #EskomMolefeReturns pic.twitter.com/Oc1fwquw6R IG: st_ndax (@ndawonde_xolani) May 12, 2017#Sanxonworldshebeen regulars after hearing the reappointment of #BrianMolefe #EskomMolefeReturns pic.twitter.com/Oc1fwquw6R#BrianMolefe Walking in like #Eskom pic.twitter.com/7ELnhSbyzd Ayanda kolisi (@Ms_Ayas) May 12, 2017#BrianMolefe Walking in like #Eskom pic.twitter.com/7ELnhSbyzd#Molefe and #Eskom are married pic.twitter.com/SK3MLJRQVN #AlooterContinua (@shandu009) May 12, 2017#Molefe and #Eskom are married pic.twitter.com/SK3MLJRQVNBrian Molefe is making a U-turn to his old job at #Eskom.
