Dutch-born Veldwijk is eligible to play for Bafana through his father who was born in South Africa.He was named in Da Gama s squad on Thursday for the internationals against Guinea-Bissau in Durban on March 25 and Angola on March 28.The big centre-forward who plies his trade with KV Kortrijk in Belgium had an unimpressive debut for SA in a 1-1 friendly draw against Mozambique in Maputo on November 15 being replaced by Bradley Grobler from the break.Veldwijk had been called up to ex-Bafana coach Shakes Mashaba s squad for that match and the 2-1 World Cup qualifying win against Senegal in Polokwane three days earlier where the striker was not fielded despite impressing in training.Da Gama said it was only fair to recall Veldwijk who had little chance to impress against Mozambique in a disjointed game where SA fielded a number of new players and untried combinations. In all honesty he did not have a good start " Bafana s caretaker-coach said."He set foot for the first time in his life in South Africa [that week]. But you don t just bring in a player and just cast him aside if he doesn t start well. I remember myself when I went to play in Belgium [for Beerschot VAC in 1984] after my first match I thought they were going to send me home."A week later I scored a hat-trick. So I base it on that."You ve got to show confidence in players."You ve got to allow them to settle. Da Gama had also taken charge of the match against Mozambique as caretaker with Mashaba having been suspended for an outburst aimed at his Safa bosses on TV after the Senegal game which led to the head coach s sacking in late December.With Safa not yet having named a new coach Da Gama continues as caretaker against Guinea-Bissau and Angola. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
