The teacher, accused of sending the images and messages to a 14-year-old pupil, was granted bail of R6000. He was represented by a high-powered legal team.The suspended teacher is facing criminal charges relating to sexual grooming of a minor and child pornography.The girl's parents said they were "disappointed" they had been excluded from the court proceedings.The father approached the prosecutor after the bail hearing to ask why they had not been allowed to sit in on the application."I won't let this matter rest. It's unbelievable that we, as parents who brought the charges against him, had to sit outside the courtroom. We were completely in the dark and made out to be fools."The parents later learnt that the prosecutor, who refused to identify herself to the media, was unaware they were present in court.The teacher beat a hasty retreat with his supporters in tow.The media was also barred by the presiding magistrate from covering the teacher's bail bid. Objections were raised by reporters, who were informed by the prosecutor that juvenile matters were held in camera.However, there were celebrations outside Court 9 after the alleged sex pest was granted bail.The teacher's supporters, most of them congregants of the church he attends, broke into applause.He was arrested two weeks ago after the father became suspicious of pictures and texts on the girl's phone. The accused's next appearance will be June 30.
