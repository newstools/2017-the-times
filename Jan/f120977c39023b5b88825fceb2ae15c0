Mantashe expressed his disappointment with the SA Football Association s (Safa) decision at a media briefing ahead of the ANC s birthday celebration at Orlando Stadium on Sunday. That is why we meet every year and talk about these things. By the time we come to the January statement we must be able to say this is the way forward. [We must be able to say] what are we doing with unemployment poverty inequality. We must be able to say this is what we are doing about food security in the aftermath of the drought said Mantashe. What are we doing with shortage of water? How do we punish people who allow water to run in the streets? What are we going to do with the expulsion of Shakes Mashaba? It can't be right. It can t be right that Shakes Mashaba is fired. I don't support that action Mantashe said.After briefing the media Mantashe then moved to Vilakazi Street in Orlando West Soweto where President Jacob Zuma later addressed the crowd. Mashaba sat in front of the crowd with other ANC leaders. Last month Safa dismissed Mashaba when he still had a year left in his contract which was to run until the end of the Russia World Cup in July next year. Mashaba was suspended after Bafana beat Senegal 2-1 in a World Cup qualifier in Polokwane on November 12 when he wagged a finger and angrily remonstrated Safa officials including its president Danny Jordaan ahead of his post-match TV interview.He accused his Safa bosses of not supporting him and his rant delayed a scheduled SABC television interview until he calmed down.
