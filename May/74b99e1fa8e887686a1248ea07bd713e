Kholiwe was grilled by the families of her potential dates harder than a burnt steak and still, somehow, walked away with her prince charming.While fans of the show went crazy over her search for the perfect date, others were left with some pretty important questions.Just check out these three questions we had after watching the show:Is it okay to not have a kid by 27?Twitter went crazy when bachelor Solly said that he found it strange that Kholiwe did not have any kids.People filled the social media site with memes and comments asking when it had become a rule that women should have kids by 27?So not having kids at 27 is not okay?! #DMFMzansi #DateMyFamily pic.twitter.com/rbsyKJwHlU Jenny Sicwebu (@Just_TheJeneral) May 7, 2017#DateMyFamily Hao Solly I didn't know that it was mandatory to to have kids before the age of 27 pic.twitter.com/IyYTzmYiah Precious (@KenewangR) May 7, 2017Solly wat r u tryin to say bwt 27 yr olds with no kids...
