The gathering inspired much mirth and derision as many of those uniformed protectors appeared too young to have even been born when the armed struggle was being waged.Respected MK veterans who have been calling the party to order over the state of its leadership said they had no idea who the "veterans" were and said they were an insult to their "fallen heroes".This week there was another, more tragic, face to the MK veterans - that of about 5,000 veterans who say they have been waiting in vain for years for houses promised to them by the state.Military veterans who are unemployed or who earn below a threshold are entitled to a subsidy for a house worth R175,000. This deal is intended to acknowledge the sacrifice that many made to see South Africa become a democracy.Of all the constituencies the ANC serves, one would imagine that this would be among the most important.Yet the veterans describe the opposite. They say they are ignored and forgotten. In one recent case scores of people who said they were veterans forcibly invaded homes in a project built for them but where houses had long stood vacant and unallocated.This week a "military veterans housing dialogue" with Human Settlements Minister Lindiwe Sisulu heard similar frustrations. Among the most moving was the story of a woman veteran who said she was destitute at the age of 45 and had entered relationships simply so she would have a roof over her head.The ANC government has much of which to be proud and, of late, much of which to be ashamed. Its treatment of these veterans must rank high among the latter.
