Sbu took a trip down memory lane, remembering how he couldn't remember his dad saying, "I love you son". "Well there was this one time when he came home drunk and I pretended to be asleep so he doesn't wake me up and send me to do chores lol. But that day he came in, closed the door, turned on the lights, and came to where I was sleeping and removed the blanket off my face and said, 'ingane yami le' (that's my baby)," Sbu said. Sbu said that since his dad's death it was a memory he'll treasure forever."Before you sleep tonight, please tell your kids you love them. They might need it later in life. #RestInPeaceDad," added Sbu.
