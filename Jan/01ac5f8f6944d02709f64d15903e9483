The league s announcement caught observers by surprise as it was made on the eve of the ANC s 105th birthday celebration at Orlando Stadium on Sunday.It was also contrary to the party s move to quell the succession debate and its secretary-general Gwede Mantashe said on Monday that it was actually an ill-timed reaction .Mantashe however said it was merely an angry reaction to structures outside the party announcing their preferred candidates such as Cosatu which announced last year that it preferred Cyril Ramaphosa to lead.The Women s League secretary-general Meokgo Matuba said on Tuesday: In its 105 years of existence the ANC has never had a female president and 50 % representation in the top sic of the ANC. That glass ceiling will be broken by having a female president giving closing remarks in the 54th ANC National Conference in December 2017 and other female cadres being in the top six of the organisation. She said the league made the decision at its extended national executive committee on Friday and Saturday ahead of the Sunday anniversary celebrations. In true pursuance of the ANC's policy of equality and non-sexism the ANCWL will not be persuaded to stop its decision to call for the members of the ANC to elect its first-ever woman as president in December 2017 and having women equally forming part of the ANC top six. Matuba noted that while the unity and integrity of the ANC is sacrosanct the league will clarify to the ANC its decision to release the summary report of its NEC meeting and not engage the ANC through public platforms .
