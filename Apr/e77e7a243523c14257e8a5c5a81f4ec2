Academics who studied data from the 2012 census were particularly perturbed to find high levels of ignorance about contraception among 15- to 19-year-olds.Part of the context for the concern expressed in the South African Medical Journal by Matthew Chersich of the Wits Reproductive Health and HIV Institute, is that 83% of 15- to 19-year-old women are sexually active.It's not all bad news: more women are using modern contraception, and mothers are having fewer children - 2.3 on average, down from 2.7 a decade earlier.But the researchers say we could be doing so much better, and they have a good idea where to point the finger. "It is very disappointing that many young women leave school with little knowledge of contraception," they say.Schools are supposed to make contraception and condoms available, but this requires the go-ahead of governing bodies and "few have given permission", the researchers say. Perhaps they object to the law that says anyone over the age of 12 has the right to receive contraception without parental consent.The rise in the number of abortions across all age groups is a reliable indicator that all is not well. And the new research hardly touches on the risks of HIV transmission implicit in the finding that unplanned pregnancies have become a national epidemic.It's four years since the health department issued its policies on contraception, but Chersich and his team say that "what is available in primary level facilities ... is extremely limited in some districts".The solutions to the problems identified in the study already exist. All that is needed to defuse the time bomb quietly ticking under the lives of women - particularly those in disadvantaged circumstances - is the determination to do so.
