"It is possibly the only process that will be able to get to bottom of these allegations and determine the truthfulness or lack thereof," said Ramaphosa.He was speaking at the Chris Hani memorial l ecture in Uitenhage, Eastern Cape, yesterday.Ramaphosa, who was joined on stage by former deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas and several SACP members, said "brown envelopes" had become a problem in the ruling party."It is therefore critical that the allegations of state capture should be put to rest because they are the elephant in the room."Ramaphosa said the truth would "set the ANC free", and safeguard the party's unity."We need a [formal] process so that we stop gossiping and talking in corners about these matters."Ramaphosa warned that money would be used to buy votes and favours leading up to the ANC elective conference in December.He said it was undeniable that the ANC was going through a period of turbulence and uncertainty, worse than at any time since 1994."The manner and the form of the cabinet reshuffle a few weeks ago heightened those tensions within the movement," said Ramaphosa."Whether we want to dismiss it or not, the reality is that it triggered the heightening of tensions, causing some comrades to engage in bitter exchanges in public statements and on social media."SACP Eastern Cape secretary Xolile Nqatha did not mince his words either when he reiterated the call for President Jacob Zuma to step down.He said the claim that the ANC's power base had shifted was an understatement - saying instead that from where he stood it had completely left."Power has gone and it's one thing to say that the centre does not hold or the centre is weak because the centre is gone and it's in Saxonwold," said Nqatha .
