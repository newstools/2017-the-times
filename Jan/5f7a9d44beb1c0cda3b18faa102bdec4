Vincent Walters 49 and his girlfriend Noleen de Grame 50 from the Cape Town suburb of Brooklyn appeared briefly in Cape Town Magistrate s Court on Tuesday.They have been in custody for seven weeks and face charges of attempted murder and robbery after allegedly biting the stomach and back of Theresa Simons - after a drinking session in which they attempted to suck her blood.The incident reportedly took place at the couple s house after Simons and her husband went to visit them.The two couples are said to have consumed four boxes of wine. Simons husband then reportedly left to take a nap in the park and Simons 53 told police she started feeling as if she had been drugged before the couple held her down and bit her.One of the couple's friends Maya Sawicka said she found the incident unlikely because Simons was a pole dancer and De Grame who had diabetes and asthma would not have been able to overpower her. Noleen is very sick. She is diabetic and she have very heavy asthma... So I don't see how she could attack and hold down Theresa. Theresa was a pole dancer said Sawicka.The case has been postponed to January 18 for a bail hearing. Walters and De Grame have been in custody since their arrest on November 21.
