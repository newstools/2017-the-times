The ANC government is using the same tactics used by the apartheid regime to detain without trial and to deal with those it deems as enemies of the state. How do you keep a young man in jail for four months. This is unreasonable detention. He needs our support and we will support him said Malema.Khanyile a leader in the EFF Student Command was out on bail for charges levelled against him in February when he was arrested in September.Khanyile s next court date is January 19 and will remain in custody at least until then.
