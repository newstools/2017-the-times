Eskom announced this week that the Hendrina Kriel Komati Grootvlei and Camden power stations would be closed.NUMSA said on Sunday that at least 6 000 jobs were on the line and wanted to place it on record that no consultation had taken place between the board of Eskom and trade unions. Furthermore as NUMSA we are convinced that the lack of consultation demonstrates that there is an attempt to hide the real reasons for this drastic course of action said NUMSA general secretary Irvin Jim. He said Eskom was well aware that if it had plans to end jobs or retrench workers it must follow due process which included declaring a section 189 so that proper retrenchment processes could take place which had not happened. NUMSA has been engaging workers on the ground to establish the next course of action. If necessary we will go on strike and if that means plunging the country into darkness then that is the strategy we must adopt. As NUMSA we will do whatever is legally necessary to defend the thousands of jobs which are at stake Jim asserted. We are looking to engage with the NUM (National Union of Mineworkers) on this issue. For the sake of the workers we need to put our ideological differences aside to formulate a united strategy to fight this attack on workers. NUMSA is also consulting with lawyers to establish if it has any legal recourse to deal with the latest onslaught against workers and their families Jim added.
