Khabonina joined the Isidingo family in 2015 and has become a firm fan favourite on the show.The one thing that everyone loves about Nina is that she is shrewd, cunning and will stop at nothing to get what she wants.Nina is also quite the charmer with the men, which is something Khabonina admires about her."The way Nina deals with men, if she wants you, she will just go after you. A lot of guys wonder why I can't do the things I do on television, but if I like a guy I would walk past him, then turn around, and probably have to do a twirl or something," she said.Khabonina added that the reason she liked playing 'shrewd and cunning' Nina was because she was so far from that."At times I argue with her, script wise. As women we are all very colourful and all have bits of Nina in us, and I recognise that and am able to explore the Nina in me," she added.The one thing that Khabonina does have in common with her on-screen character is that they are both hard workers and would stop at nothing to achieve their goals.Khabonina explained that being cast on Isidingo has been a dream that she has had for years.In fact her journey on the soapie started years ago when she played an extra, but only lasted a day."Being an extra didn't feel right. Things don't happen when you want it to but I knew it would happen some day."And years later Khabonina is living out her dream!
