Picture Supplied One would think that Axel would have it all and would be inundated with Valentine's gifts and messages but this is not the case. His heart and full-time commitment leaves little time for romance and Valentines. His heart is taken by Nandi said orphanage head Karen Trendler. But Axel will have to work hard to keep Nandi s attention. That included a slog through the bush on Valentine s Day to get her just what she wanted. Roses and chocolates just don't do it for Nandi. Axel had to take a walk into the thick bush in search of her favourite browse.

And if you re thinking of jumping in just know that Nandi and the other rhino that Axel cares for are very possessive and deal with any competition with a typical black rhino huff head butt and charge. Any lady with an eye on Axel as a potential Valentine would need to be prepared to sleep on piles of straw get muddy mix vast volumes of milk cut lots of thorny browse and run like hell when Nandi gets jealous said Trender. - TMG Digital/The Times
