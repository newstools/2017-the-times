"President Muhammadu Buhari today resumed duties after his vacation," said presidential spokesman Femi Adesina in a statement.Buhari, 74, returned to Nigeria last week Friday after nearly two months' medical leave in Britain, saying he "couldn't recall being so sick since I was a young man".The health of Nigeria's president has become a sensitive issue following the 2010 death of president Umaru Musa Yar'Adua from a long-standing, but undisclosed, kidney complaint.
