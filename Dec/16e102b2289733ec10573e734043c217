Pinky Girl gained instant fame after featuring on Bonang's reality show, Being Bonang and now that she's tasted stardom, she wants more.  Pinky Girl told TshisaLIVE that she couldn't deny that she gets more attention now that she has a "recognisable" face. "I didn't realise how serious people take TV, like if you appear on TV, things and people around you change. Some changes are good, some bad and some just weird but personally I haven't changed. It's just that people recognise me know and it is kind of amazing." She added that although it personally doesn't faze her, the prospect of making a career in entertainment has changed her goals . "My partner had to get used to my new found 'fame' but lucky for me he’s very supportive. As much I want some things to remain the same, I can definitely say that settling down and having kids may be postponed to age 33 now. I mean life happened." The reality TV star also previously shared how she and B got to be close friends. "Bonang and I grew up like sisters because we were both only children. We've always been sisters, wearing the same clothes and going to almost everything together. I love that we are at our most natural when we are around each other." She also slammed any suggestions that the show was scripted and said often she did not even know the camera was recording her outings with Bonang. "When I'm with her (Bonang), we always have people with cameras around us. The reason our outings are so real is because we were just living our lives and at the time I had no idea for some time that the footage would be used for the reality show."
