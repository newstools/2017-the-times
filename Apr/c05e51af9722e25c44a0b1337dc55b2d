Scrumhalf Dewaldt Duvenage will start in place of the concussed Jano Vermaak, while tighthead Wilco Louw returns from injury to unseat his Springbok counterpart Frans Malherbe in the starting lineup.They are the only changes to the starting side that beat the Cheetahs 53-10 at Newlands for this weekend's highly anticipated clash. "It's up to us as a group now to understand who we are facing and remember what happened last year and measure ourselves against that," Fleck said. "The Chiefs under Dave Rennie haven't changed much in the past four years and over the period since they won the Super Rugby title."They are physical and play with extreme intensity and tempo, which was what caught us out last year. They are tactically smart and pride themselves on their aggression. We haven't faced a team as good as them this year." The Chiefs and the Stormers are both undefeated in what is a repeat of last year's quarterfinal, which the New Zealanders won 60-21.The Stormers' form that has seen them score 29 tries in five matches has not escaped the visitors.STORMERS: 15 SP Marais, 14 Cheslin Kolbe, 13 EW Viljoen, 12 Dan du Plessis, 11 Dillyn Leyds, 10 Robert du Preez, 9 Dewaldt Duvenage, 8 Sikhumbuzo Notshe, 7 Siya Kolisi (capt), 6 Cobus Wiese, 5 Pieter-Steph du Toit, 4 Eben Etzebeth, 3 Wilco Louw, 2 Bongi Mbonambi, 1 JC Janse van RensburgBENCH: 16 Ramone Samuels, 17 Oli Kebble, 18 Frans Malherbe, 19 Jan de Klerk, 20 Nizaam Carr, 21 Justin Phillips, 22 Kurt Coleman, 23 Dan Kriel - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
