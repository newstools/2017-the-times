As fans call on Bonang and Somizi to bury the hatchet and become friends again (you know, so we can get those amazing Instagram poses again) it seems like B is not going to budge.Sunday Sun reported that both of them were recently at an event but when Bonang entered and saw Somizi there, she not only avoided him, but asked to be moved to a different marquee. It's not the first time they've had to face each other at a public event. It was last year reported that B's man AKA slammed a door into Somizi's face, bruising him so badly that he had to have extra make-up put on before he went onto stage for his MC duties.In an interview with Anele on Real Talk Somizi opened up about their friendship and said that Bonang was "my Lebo Mathosa."Bonang apparently blocked Somizi after she heard that he was giving info to DJ Zinhle, AKA's baby mama.B has openly said that she will never speak about their fight and those close to her have told TshisaLIVE that the more Somizi opens up about their issues, the angrier she gets."She's got an image to protect and Somizi is like a thorn in her side now. They were a 'power couple' and his light is brighter than hers. It's annoying. She does still love him but she doesn't need him right now," said a source.Like any friendship, a friend in need is a friend indeed, right? And as B continues to soar, best you hold onto any thoughts of them getting back together... for now.
