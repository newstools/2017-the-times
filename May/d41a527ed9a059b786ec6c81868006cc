In a dramatic post-lunch session it was revealed that the hairs that were found in the palms of Marli van Breda's hands as she lay fighting for her life after a triple family murder could not possibly have been those of her brother Henri as they were much longer than the haircut he had on the day of the murders.According to his defence counsel Piet Botha (and confirmed by the forensic analyst on the case Colonel Henry Stewart) the hairs found in the exhibit which had been taken from the palms of Marli's hands were longer than 200mm.However based on a photograph of Henri taken on the morning of 27 January 2015 when police arrived at 12 Goske Street his hair is no longer than "50mm to 80mm".In light of the difference between the hair found in Marli's hands and the hairstyle that the accused had at the time Botha asked What are the chances that the hair could have come from my client's head on the day of the murder? Stewart replied Very slim. Botha then boomed I would say nil! Stewart admitted that by the time he tested the hair Van Breda's hair would have grown substantially but that had he seen the photographs of his close-cut hair style on the day of the murders he would have been able to exclude him .This came in the wake of a morning session during which Stewart when questioned by the state claimed that the hair in her hand was "forcibly removed" and that ""if there were signs of hair from a person of another race on the crime scene it would have showed up".This discredited Henri's claims that he thought it was a person of colour who had intruded on the family home at 12 Goske Street.However Stewart was then was then accused of providing "false impressions" and supplying a "misleading affidavit" and therefore skewing "crucial" evidence.It came to light it was entirely possible there were foreign hairs on the scene of the crime since a match wasn't found in the lab for all of the fourteen hairs under the microscope.It also came to light that the hair might have ended up in her hands after she had clutched an object on which the hairs were already sitting.Then Stewart was asked to read out the instruction letter provided to him by investigating officer Colonel Deon Beneke from 20 March 2015 in which Beneke clearly stated that the hair could be that of "suspect" Henri van Breda.Botha said this showed that Stewart was lying under oath when he claimed that he was looking at "numbered samples" with no knowledge of the personal identity of those whose hair it was.Stewart defended himself by saying that he had proceeded without reading the covering letter in an attempt not to prejudice his scientific analysis but Botha said this was not something he could expect the court to really believe.The case continues.TMG Digital/TimesLIVE
