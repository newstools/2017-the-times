As the fires blazed, many residents scrambled to evacuate dogs, cats, horses, cows, ducks and chickens from smallholdings, farms and wine estates.In some cases, there was little time to transport the animals.Lou Purcell, owner of an animal feed company, had to chase 50 sheep down the street on Tuesday night.Purcell said they managed to retrieve most of them.They also found two of their cows, which had been transported to a property nearby, roaming around in the Sir Lowry's Pass Village.The home of one of Purcell's employees was razed."He lost everything, but the community have already rallied around to get him back on his feet. He's already been offered a house and there's all sorts of donations coming through, which is amazing," she said."I also have a free-range poultry business, so we had to let go of all the ducks and chickens, but I think they haven't strayed too far and they're coming back slowly."She managed to evacuate five dogs and seven cats in her car.Six of Purcell's horses were taken away by residents and animal-welfare organisations.Sadly, some lambs were mauled by dogs.Rescue workers found a young springbok that was injured in the fire.A primate sanctuary near Sir Lowry's Pass had to release 38 vervet monkeys, four baboons and many dogs.The sanctuary's owner, Pat O' Neill, 91, had no other choice because the flames were getting too close.O' Neill said that the sanctuary had been damaged, but that all the animals had returned . - TMG Digital/The Times
