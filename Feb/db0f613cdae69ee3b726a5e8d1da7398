This comes as more than 1000 people participated in an anti-foreigner march in Pretoria on Friday. As a South African a proud African I want to condemn any acts of violence undertaken against nationals from our continent who are not South Africans said Maimane.A number of foreign-owned shops were attacked this week in areas such as Atteridgeville Mamelodi and Pretoria West. It follows violence in Rosettenville in Johannesburg where 12 houses were torched. There are rising fears of a fresh wave of xenophobic attacks.On Friday the streets of Tshwane turned chaotic after people started vandalising shelters of Malawi and Zimbabwe pilgrims who were in town to attend a weekend church service by Prophet Shepherd Bushiri.Maimane said it is important for the government to ensure effective policing in troubled areas. The anger that South Africans are experiencing ... should be directed to a government that has failed said Maimane.He said locals should act legally and not use Africans from other countries as scapegoats. You can t simple say the blame must be on foreign nationals when people are without work are without opportunity. It is a flaw of government he said.
