Strong winds that battered the coastline caused a container-laden ship to block the Durban harbour mouth on Tuesday. Four tugs were attempting to pull the vessel clear‚ according to a member of the disaster management team dealing with the storm that struck parts of the city‚ causing flash flooding. A second vessel broke its mooring and was stuck on a sand bank within the harbour. Transnet did not initially respond to queries about the incident.
