Earlier today Phahlane lodged an application in the Pretoria High Court to have the search and seizure warrant - used by the Directorate to raid his Pretoria home last month - declared unlawful and to have the Directorate stop using private investigator Paul O'Sullivan in their investigations.The Directorate is yet to receive the application although their spokesman Moses Dlamini says they will oppose it.Phahlane is being investigated for corruption in relation to tenders he allegedly awarded to chemical suppliers who won a contract with the police forensic science laboratory which Phahlane used to head.He is also being investigated for defeating the ends of justice.Phahlane's spokesperson Brigadier Sally De Beer in an SMS confirmed the commissioner had filed an application at court."Please note the intention of the High Court application is not to stop any investigation from continuing but to address specific issues to ensure that it is conducted lawfully within the constraints of specific legislation."
