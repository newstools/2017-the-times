Several eyewitnesses have detailed how they waited in vain for an ambulance to arrive at the scene after making numerous calls for help."He (Mandla) was awake and calling for the owner. He was talking. He was breathing," one of the patrons told TshisaLIVE outside the bar on Monday."EMS spokesperson Nana Radebe has confirmed a call was received but paramedics were unable to help. We did receive a call at 22.45pm but all our ambulances in the area were committed and could not attend to the call, so we referred the call to Netcare, Radebe said.She said the closest ambulance to the Meli tavern was delayed at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital. The hospital is less than 5km from where Mandla lay gasping for breath."Bara (Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital) is right here. We waited for long. It must've been over an hour. He was still breathing. We ran around trying to find a pillow to put under his head. The owner of the pub was holding him and women were leaning over him. He took his last breath on that cold floor," said a patron.Netcare 911 say its paramedics arrived on the scene 20 minutes after receiving the call."We can confirm that Netcare 911 received a call for assistance at 22h43. The Netcare 911 response vehicle arrived on scene at 23h07," said Netcare 911 Managing Director Craig Grindell.
