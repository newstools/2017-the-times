Margeman netted the opener for the home team and was a constant thorn in the side of Stars as Ndiviwe Mdabuka added a second, providing a deserved victory for the home side, who should have won by a greater margin but for some wasteful finishing.They move up to 29 points from 26 matches, just three points off Maritzburg United in seventh place, with their relegation worries now surely a thing of the past.Stars stay four points ahead of bottom side Highlands Park, and just three ahead of Free State Stars in the relegation play-off position, though they have a game in hand on both of those. Ajax coach Stanley Menzo made two changes from the side that lost 2-0 to Mamelodi Sundowns last time out, bringing in midfielders Mdabuka and Mark Mayambela.And it was the industrious Under-20 international Margeman who was pulling the strings in the centre of the park and gave his side the lead inside seven minutes.Travis Graham provided the pass and Margeman lashed the ball home from a tightening angle, beating Stars keeper Mbongeni Mzimela at his near post.From then it was all Ajax in the first half, with their goalkeeper Brandon Petersen not having a save of note to make in the opening 45 minutes.Prince Nxumalo wasted two headed chances, and then had an even better opportunity to give his side a 2-0 advantage when he found himself one-on-one with Mzimela, but had his effort from 10-yards saved.Stars came out with more vigour in the second half, but it was Mayambela at the other end with the clearest opening, but his goal-bound effort was deflected for a corner by Robert Ng ambi.Margeman continued to be a livewire and his superb ball to the back post found an unmarked Nathan Paulse, on as a substitute Nxumalo, but he skied his effort at goal.Moments later Thabo Mosadi was the next to have a clear-cut opportunity, only to shoot wide, as the chances continue to mount, and be wasted, for Ajax.The home side finally got their insurance goal as Mdabuka s shot from the edge of the area on 65 minutes took a deflection off teammate Paulse, wrong-footing Mzimela and lodging in the back of the net.Mayambela was warming to his task in the second half and might have done better when he skied a shot with just Mzimela to beat, but it mattered little as Ajax comfortably held on for the win.OTHER ABSA PREMIERSHIP RESULTS:Friday, 28 April 2017:Highlands Park 0 - 2 Bidvest Wits Golden Arrows v Mamelodi Sundowns Saturday, 29 April 2017:Free State Stars 1 - 2 Polokwane CitySuperSport United 2 - 2 Kaizer ChiefsOrlando Pirates 2 -1 Chippa UnitedSunday, 30 April 2017:Baroka FC 1 - 1 Bloemfontein Celtic - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
