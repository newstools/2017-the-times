Yes the DA leader had a bullet-proof vest on. It was a precautionary measure given security analysis provided she said on Friday afternoon.Van Damme said the DA march was peaceful and a beautiful expression of unity in diversity. We are proud of South Africans today .In response to the questions about the vest Maimane told reporters outside the Union Buildings in Pretoria: I am the father of two kids a husband to one wife. It would be irresponsible of me knowing that people have threatened my life not to take all the precautions I can take. It is the first time threats against Maimane have been serious enough to warrant the wearing of a vest. See his explain his reason for wearing the vest here.Mmusi here.
