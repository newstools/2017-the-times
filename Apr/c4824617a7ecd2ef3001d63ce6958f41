Some of the biggest brands in Britain and the US have pulled hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising from Google and YouTube after they were promoted next to extremist content.Google has now admitted that its computers struggled to "understand context" and said it was using its "greatest machine-learning abilities" to try to solve the issue.In an interview with The New York Times, Philipp Schindler, Google's chief business officer, said the company had been in "emergency mode" over the issue of extremist content. "We take this as seriously as we've ever taken a problem," he said.Google was training its computer systems to recognise offensive videos by analysing them on a frame-by-frame basis and comparing them with descriptions of content.Schindler said: "Computers have a much harder time understanding context, and that's why we're actually using all of our latest and greatest machine-learning abilities now to get a better feel for this."The company hoped its programmes would be able to identify the difference between a film star waving a gun and an extremist.However, Google said it would never be able to solve the problem completely as 400 hours of new content were uploaded to YouTube every minute."No system can be 100% perfect," Schindler said. "But we're working as hard as we can to make it as safe as possible."More than 250 organisations, including Toyota, Tesco and McDonald's, stopped advertising on YouTube after it emerged that they were being promoted on videos posted by hate preachers, rape apologists and extremists.Last week Google and some of the world's biggest internet companies agreed to create new "technical tools to identify and remove terrorist propaganda" in the wake of the Westminster attacks in London.The companies, which included Facebook and Twitter, also agreed to look at "options" for a body "to accelerate" how they take down extremist content.However, they were accused of paying "lip service" to the problem because they would not commit themselves to setting up an industry body to tackle it.It comes as a former head of the US's Central Intelligence Agency said technology companies must work with governments to prevent terrorists communicating in secret using services such as WhatsApp.Speaking in the UK this week ahead of delivering a lecture on freedom of speech, John Brennan called for tech companies to find a way to protect the privacy of their users, while also allowing intelligence services to do their jobs. - The Daily Telegraph
