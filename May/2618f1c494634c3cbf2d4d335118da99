Benfica who were also crowned league champions this season took a 2-0 lead early in the second half but Zungu gave his side hope with a headed goal from a corner 12 minutes from time his second of the campaign.Vitoria pressed for an equaliser in difficult wet conditions but it was not to be and Zungu had to be content with a silver medal.The consolation will be his goal against a Benfica side who have targeted him as a signing in the next transfer window but first he will hope to be as influential for Bafana Bafana in their African Nations Cup qualifier against Nigeria next month having been recalled to the side by new coach Stuart Baxter.Another recalled player was also on target as Tokelo Rantie netted for Turkish side Genclerbirligi in their 2-1 win over Bursaspor.Rantie s goal was a fine finish making space for himself with a touch with his right foot and then blasting the ball home with his left.Swedish-based winger Mihlali Mayambela was also on target when he netted his first goal for Degerfors in their 2-1 win over GAIS.It was another thunderous finish as he collected the ball on the edge of the box and powered his shot into the roof of the net.Tiya Shipalane was the fourth South African to find the back of the net when he scored for USA second-tier side North Carolina though it proved a late consolation as they lost 2-1 to Jacksonville Armada.Kurt Abrahams drew a blank as he was a late substitute for Belgian top-flight side St Truiden in their 3-0 loss to Genk in a qualifier for a place in the UEFA Europa League next season.Genk will now play Andile Jali s KV Oostende on Wednesday for a place in the Europa League.Finally Lars Veldwijk who has been dropped from the Bafana squad by Baxter was not on target for Norwegian side Aalesund as they drew 1-1 at Brann.
