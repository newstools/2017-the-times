We asked Sunday Times readers to swap those wasted hours stuck in traffic for a quick commute on the Gautrain, spend the time they saved experimenting in the kitchen and send us their best speedy recipes. We've narrowed down the entries to our top 10 favourites. Now, to win one of the grand prizes, the finalists must battle it out in a fun cook-off. They'll recreate their recipes for a host of celebrity judges in Joburg - and you can get FREE tickets to watch all the action! You'll also have the chance to nab some terrific prizes at the event.
