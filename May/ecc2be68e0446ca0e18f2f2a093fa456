While the rest of the world can't get enough of the henna tattoos on Bey's baby bump and the African prints, AKA is far from impressed.The rapper did not mince his words when he weighed in on Bey's baby show. He also made it crystal clear that he is not afraid of the 'Beyhive'.For all this Africa themed baby stuff, Beyonc seems pretty reluctant to come here. Stinks of cultural appropriation.AKA has been involved in a couple of twars with the Beyhive in the past, but that did not deter him from saying his piece.The rapper hit back at the Beyhive making it clear that their tweets did not affect his life.So this beyhive? I tweet my opinion, then you tweet me? I'm missing the part where it affects my life or the part where she performs in SASo y'all so brainwashed you gotta throw racial abuse at me to defend Beyonc ? There's nothing cool about mindless obedience.Anyway .... I've said my piece. Halla at me when she's LIVE in SA. I'll buy two tickets.Francois Pienaar more AFRICAN than Beyonc bruh!!!!!!!I only recognize one QUEEN B and she was born and raised in A F R I C A
