Durban topped the new 2017 Property ROI Index created by London-based online estate agent Nested.The index compares how long it takes to make back the value of a property using Airbnb as a service compared to the traditional rental market.Airbnb is an online marketplace and homestay network. It lets people list or rent short-term lodging in residential properties while the owner of the accommodation sets the rent cost. Founded in August of 2008 and based in San Francisco California it operates in some 191 countries. Aside from offering a guaranteed sale within three months our goal at Nested is to help people get the most value from their homes. We created the 2017 Property ROI Index to better understand global variations in real estate prices from an investment perspective Nested said on their web site. For 75 international cities we researched thousands of properties sold in the last 12 months or currently on the market to find the average price of a three-bedroom property. For each market we calculated exactly how long it would take you in months to recoup the property value based on average rental and Airbnb costs it said.The research showed that a property in Durban would take 167 months to recuperate value via traditional rental methods and 18 months via Airbnb which was the shortest time period worldwide.In second place was Lagos third was Cairo fourth Reykjavik and fifth was Johannesburg which would take 180 months via traditional means and 33 months via Airbnb. Cape Town placed twelfth after the likes of Santiago Athens Bangalore Dubai Bucharest and Medellin. It would take 205 months to recuperate the value of an average house in Cape Town using old school rental methods or 55 months using Airbnb.This compares to Lagos Nigeria where it takes the least amount of time to recuperate property value via traditional renting at 132 months and Taipei Taiwan where it takes the longest coming in at 693 months.Properties in Beijing China take the most amount of time to recuperate their value via Airbnb rental at 714 months on average.Nested used closed property sales in the past six months and current market listings for all locations researched. Data for the study also came from the World Bank HSBC data record offices in each city and the Economist magazine s research arm.-TMG Digital/BusinessLIVE
