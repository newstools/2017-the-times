Western Cape High Court Judge Yasmin Meer ruled last Thursday in favour of Sherelle Naidu who had claimed that the minister was negligent via the actions of officials at Brandvlei prison in allowing Marius Michaels to be released on parole while serving a nine-and-a-half-year sentence for theft assault and weapons charges.Michaels who has a string of previous convictions dating back some 26 years to 1980 for crimes ranging from theft and assault to escaping from custody and murder attacked Naidu in her home in Somerset-West on 19 July 2010.He bit the teacher and brandishing a knife threatened to murder and rape her. For this and several related crimes Michaels was sentenced to a further 15 years. He remains behind bars.But Naidu believes he should never have been released in the first place and the judge agreed listing several glaring errors in the handling of Michaels s parole.She pointed out that former social worker at Brandvlei Jacobus Pansegrouw had testified that it was impossible to change a life marked by an abusive and violent history within the two to three days of group programmes which Michaels had gone through.Pansegrouw told the court he believed further intervention by the prison s parole board would have been necessary for a determination on Michael s parole readiness. Based on his experience of more than 20 years as a therapist he concluded that Michaels should not have been released on parole on the information before the board Meer writes in her judgment.The judge was less impressed with the testimony of Shafiel Adonis a clerk of the parole board at Brandvlei Prison and one of the three members of the board that took the decision to grant Michaels parole in 2009. During cross-examination Adonis acknowledged that Michaels had not been referred to a psychologist and that there had been no psychologist s report before the board. He conceded that the negative factors pertaining to Michaels namely his many previous convictions his escapes from custody and the disciplinary offences whilst incarcerated did not suggest rehabilitation the judge writes.Also testifying was Geraldine Suzanne Lewis a social worker and author of the crucial social work progress report dated 14 October 2009 upon which the board took the decision to release Michaels on parole. Lewis' interaction with Michaels commenced in November 2007 when he was transferred from the maximum to the medium section of the prison. She testified in chief that she had conducted individual therapy with Michaels about five times concerning mostly relationships with his family and contact with them. During cross-examination she said that she could not actually remember these sessions Meer writes.The judge said both the prison s case management committee and the parole board had failed to comply with their obligations under the Correctional Services Act 111 of 1998.A reasonable person in the position of the board who knew of Michaels history as a habitual violent criminal would have foreseen in the absence of any clear evidence of rehabilitation the reasonable possibility of his conduct if released on parole injuring another . But for Michaels' release on parole the plaintiff would not have been attacked by him. The Board and the Case Management Committee had a direct legal duty to protect members of the public from persons on parole as was correctly conceded by the Defendant [the minister] and failed to meet that duty by negligent commission an act for which the defendant is liable the judge wrote.Accordingly she found in favour of Naidu and ordered the minister to pay all the costs accumulated to date.As both parties had agreed to separate the merits of the negligence claim from the damages for the purposes of the case the amount of compensation Naidu will receive is yet to be decided. - TMG Digital
