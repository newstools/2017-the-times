"The board's meeting on Monday welcomed the forensic investigations from the mayors office to be conducted by Sizwe Nsabula Gobodo [Incorporated] and pledged to give this process our overwhelming support " said Chikane.Earlier this month the mayor said that he had decided to investigate the state entity after information was handed to his office including allegations that the Chikane's wife was awarded a tender purported to be a project of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research.Through a statement on Wednesday Chikane denied the claims against his spouse and vowed to take legal steps to defend himself and his wife.The reverend who is also a veteran of the African National Congress has vowed to take legal action against those that made those claims if they do not institute a public apology by Monday. He said that that under his leadership the board had driven a zero-tolerance policy against fraud and corruption. - TMG Digital
