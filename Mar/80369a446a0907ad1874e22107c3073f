This comes after the official opposition DA this week accused parastatals of bankrolling the PPF to wage a "dirty war" against Finance minister Pravin Gordhan.Minister of public enterprises Lynne Brown in her parliamenary question response revealed that the PPF had received sponsorship amounting to R440,000 from power provider Eskom and R400,000 from rail and logistics state entity Transnet. PPF deputy president Kashif Wicomb said the forum took "grave exception to this feeble attempt by the opposition party to portray the PPF its leadership throughout the country " as having done something wrong.Wicomb speaking at a press briefing held at the Black Business Council's head office in Johannesburg's Illovo said the forum regularly appointed an "independent" events management company to seek sponsorship for the PPF's annual events."Furthermore it is a known fact that Eskom sponsors other organisations such as the Afrikaanse Handelinstituut the South African Chamber of Commerce and Industry the Black Management Forum Black Business Council and Business Unity South Afirca."The big question is why is the DA electing and targeting PPF for attack?"Why is it not making the same lame and tired attack on Afrikaanse Handelinstituut or Busa?"The PPF does not need approval from the DA as to where it would source its sponsorship nor will it drive white monopoly capital narrative to gain favour from the racist DA " he said. - TMG Digital/SowetanLIVE
