The organisation's founder, Julian Assange, has again denied that Russia leaked the Democratic Party hacked e-mails that hurt Hillary Clinton's bid for the US presidency."System admins: don't let the White House destroy US history again!" the secrets-spilling website announced on Twitter, shortly before Assange gave an in-depth interview to US news network Fox. "Copy now, then send to Wiki-Leaks at your leisure."We are issuing a $20000 (about R273,000) reward for information leading to the arrest or exposure of any Obama admin agent destroying significant records," the tweet said.Assange, 45, gave Fox an extended interview at the Ecuadoran embassy in London, where he sought refuge in June 2012 to escape extradition to Sweden for questioning about a rape.He shed no light on who provided Wikileaks with thousands of hacked e-mails from the Democratic National Committee and from Clinton campaign chief John Podesta.WikiLeaks released the documents during the US election campaign in what US intelligence agencies have concluded was an attempt by Russia to tip the election in favour of Clinton's Republican rival, Donald Trump, who went on to win the White House.Assange insisted, however, that no Russian government-linked party was the source of the material."The source is not the Russian government. It is not state parties," the Australian told Fox.Trump again yesterday cast doubt on US intelligence findings that Russia hacked the election, repeating Assange's assertion that information damaging to Democrats did not come from Moscow."Julian Assange said a 14-year-old could have hacked Podesta - why was the Democratic National Committee so careless?"Thousands of e-mails hacked from the committee and Podesta were published by WikiLeaks in the weeks ahead of the November 8 US presidential election."Somebody hacked the DNC but why did they not have defences like the Republican National Committee?" Trump tweeted.The US intelligence community has concluded that the hack-and-release of the e-mails was designed to put Trump - a political neophyte who has praised Russian leader Vladimir Putin - into the Oval Office.Moscow has repeatedly dismissed the allegations that it was responsible for the hacking and cyber-meddling.Trump has asserted that US intelligence services were mistaken when they said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, a finding that led the country into war, and has publicly and repeatedly questioned their work.
