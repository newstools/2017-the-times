The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) has "parted ways" with sports presenter Robert Marawa. The public broadcaster revealed the news in a statement on Wednesday afternoon. "The SABC would like to announce that it has parted ways with sports presenter Mr Robert Marawa. SABC Sport has accepted his decision to repudiate his contract with the SABC, which he entered into with SABC Sport on June 6 2017. The SABC engaged Mr Marawa several times to try to remedy the situation," it said. Group executive of sport Sully Motsweni said Marawa had contributed immensely to the sport brand of the organisation. "It was hard for us to accept but we concede his decision," she said. The announcement comes just two weeks after Marawa removed himself from his Metro FM show after the "unfair suspension" of his radio show producer Beverly Maphangwa. Marawa remained steadfast in his decision and said he would not go on air until the situation with his producer was sorted out. UPDATE: Marawa did not know he had lost his job READ MORE:
