Manyonga who was part of a rehabilitation programme in the lead up to the Rio Olympic Games has now enrolled at an aftercare as he continues with his mission to achieve his dream of becoming one of the world s best long jumpers. I have been playing sport since an early age and I have grown to love athletics deeply " he said in a statement."Unfortunately I have been battling substance abuse since I was a teenager and it has been a difficult journey."I wanted to release this statement to show others that there is no shame in your past and empower others to shake off the stigma associated with addiction. Manyonga added that he is fully committed to the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the South African Institute for Drug Free Sport's (SAIDS) testing requirements.He said he submits to regular monitoring.The continuation of his treatment provides the best structure to achieve his personal and performance goals and it allows him to focus fully on the demands of training and competing while under the care and support of a professional support team. Decisions such as the one I have taken to be a part of a rehabilitation movement hopefully can allow others to admit to the daily challenges " he said."I am committed to staying drug free and I want to achieve great things in my career and life."To achieve my goals and dreams I understand that I will need all the support I can get."I want to thank my family Athletics South Africa (ASA) and my support team at Newton Sports Agency for all their help and support they have given me thus far."I am excited about my future. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
