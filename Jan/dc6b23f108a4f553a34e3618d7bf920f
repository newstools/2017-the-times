The former Zanaco forward had a lengthy trial at Ikamva and in the end did enough to win a contract from coach Stanley Menzo. I want to be myself play like I did at Zanaco Funga said in a club statement. I am a goalscorer and goal creator; that [attribute] has helped all the teams I have played for and I think that will also help here those are qualities that can get you into any team. The club administrators and supporters look for that type of quality and I think I will be a good addition to the team and add value. Funga is joined at the club by compatriot Rodrick Kabwe whose capture was announced last month. This is a good place a good thing to have on my CV and the perfect stepping stone for great things to follow because there are great players here that have played here which serves as great motivation to take my football to the highest level Funga said.Ajax CEO Ari Efstathiou says they are delighted to have got their man and are expecting big things from both their new Zambia recruits. Aubrey was scouted at the same time as Rodrick between them they scored 24 goals for Zanaco when they won the league last year."They both have goals in them and we are definitely bringing an attacking flair to the team which is what we have been looking for Efstathiou said. Having a pair of Zambians at the club together makes the process a lot more comfortable for both of them. Both play behind the strikers."Funga is more versatile; he can play left-wing right-wing and in attacking midfield. We have attained the mandate of bringing in more attacking players into the team for the next half of the season and we are looking forward to seeing all this flair on the field and to see how we progress. I don t think the club have ever been in such a positive mood in regards to the second half of the season with the addition of the players we brought into the club Efstathiou said. - TMG Digital
