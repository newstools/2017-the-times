The Cape Town High Court had a near full gallery on the first day of proceedings on Monday most of them made up of curious members of the public.Among those keen to observe the trial of the 22-year-old accused of murdering his father mother and brother is Linduxolo Ncombo who travelled about 120 km from Hermanus to Cape Town."I find this case very interesting. I am unemployed but I can't just sit at home all day. I need to my brain keep busy '' said Ncombo.He was an avid viewer of the Oscar Pistorius trial on television and said he would not let the opportunity to see Van Breda slip through his fingers.In addition Ncombo said he followed the Shrien Dewani case in the newspapers. To his surprise Advocate Pieter Botha who represented the UK businessman is also acting for Van Breda.Dewani was accused of murdering his wife Anni in Cape Town but was acquitted of all charges."Dewani's case... was a serious case and seemingly these cases are more or less the same. I want to know why [Dewani and Van Breda] chose the same person.''He will try to attend court every day. He said he would have loved to work as a lawyer but as he doesn't have the right qualifications attending the trial is the next best thing. - TMG Digital/The Times
