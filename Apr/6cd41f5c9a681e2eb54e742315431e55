Councils will be advised to take measures to improve the flow of traffic as part of a new clean air strategy to be unveiled soon.Up to 10 million owners of older diesel vehicles are expected to have to pay fees of up to 20 (R345) a day to drive in some urban areas under the so-called "toxin tax".That has prompted fury from thoseencouraged to buy diesels by the last Labour government.The government has been forced to reconsider its proposals for improving air quality after the High Court ruled last year that its existing strategy did not meet legal requirements. mThe Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Department for Transport must now present a joint new plan to the court on April 24.Research by Imperial College London found that driving over speed bumps in a diesel car produces 98% more nitrogen dioxide than driving over road cushions.Speed bumps force drivers to slow right down to avoid damaging their cars, whereas cushions, in groups of two or three across the road with a shallower slope, require less deceleration.The AA is putting pressure on the government to pay drivers of older diesels a scrappage fee. It says the worst polluters tend to be older and badly maintained cars.Layton Beard, spokesperson for the AA in South Africa, said the purpose of speed humps is to protect cyclists and pedestrians and their removal could have detrimental consequences."Forty percent of annual road deaths are pedestrians. If you want to remove the speed bumps, there needs to be something else in place," he said.
