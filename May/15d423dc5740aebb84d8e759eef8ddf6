These were the questions asked in the Cape Town High Court yesterday after a recording of the chilling call that Henri van Breda made to emergency management services was played.The call made on the morning of January 27 2015, when his parents and brother lay dead and his sister was fighting for her life.Call centre operator Janine Philander testified that she was convinced that Van Breda's call was a prank because he was "hesitant", "cool as a cucumber", "calmly gave details of the attack" and set the tone early in the conversation with "a giggle".Defence counsel Piet Botha argued that the sounds were merely her interpretations and claimed the "giggle" was a stuttered form of the word "please" in one instance and a sob in the other.Philander: "It sounded to me like he was hesitant, that he was thinking of what to say."Botha: "The fact that he remained polite is now working against him?"Philander: "He sounded the same throughout the call, no up and down."She said the initial moments "set the tone of the whole call" and she felt convinced it was a prank."Normally callers who phone in with this type of emergency set the tone."There was no interruption, no comeback, no getting agitated and he didn't stop me at any time."Botha said Van Breda stuttered as a child and had been coached to speak slowly and calmly as a technique to overcome this.LISTEN: Van Breda's chilling emergency call He also blamed social media for creating the perception that what he called a stutter on the tape was a "giggle" and said Philander had been influenced.Philander confirmed the first giggle had always troubled her, but the second giggle had been brought to her attention by social media.On hearing the clip again in court, she said: "It sounds even more like a giggle to me now."Judge Siraj Desai said: "You get 70 to 100 calls a day. What percentage of those are prank calls?"Philander said about 15% of all calls were prank: " Those are the ones who stay calm."
