Its scoop revealed the content of an independent report which Eskom has been sitting on for the last two years - no surprise now that we know something of what it says.The report, by the law firm Dentons, reveals that the arguments used by the state power utility to justify electricity tariff increases were largely rubbish.Instead, the Financial Mail reveals, the Dentons report paints a picture of Eskom bigwigs creaming off the top deals for themselves."In one case," reported the Financial Mail, a company sold Eskom R4.2-million worth of coal, but the cost to transport it from a nearby mine was another R2.6-million. Another R5-million was added to the bill as a "coal penalty adjustment". The bottom line: Eskom paid R13.4-million, including VAT, for R4.2-million worth of coal.The report challenges Eskom's key arguments for electricity tariff increases - the cost of coal and growing demand.In fact, the report shows there had been no significant increase in electricity demand for five years from 2008.Further, while coal prices fell by 50% between 2007 and 2015, Eskom's coal bill grew by 18% a year over the same period - a problem purely of its own making, it would seem.It's no wonder Eskom has locked this report away and is refusing to release it.What will it say now to South Africans who saw their electricity bill quadruple from 2007? That these increases were justified on the basis of lies and corruption?The National Energy Regulator needs to urgently intervene and demand an explanation and the release of the hidden report.
