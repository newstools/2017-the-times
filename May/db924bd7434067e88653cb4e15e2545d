DJ duo Sphectacula and Naves will be joining the station and will take over the afternoon drive show between 3pm and 6pm on week days.Felix Hlophe will host the midday show along with DJ Le Soul and comedian Fly Motion as a "field man."That means that Trevor "TP" Phillips and Thandolwethu will be leaving Gagasi but there's obviously no beef. "The chemistry that exists between the two of them as a team is unbelievable and that worked very well for the show. Changing the presenters was purely a business decision in terms of how the brand needed to move forward," said programme manager Mimi Kesaris.
