DA finance spokesman David Maynier said Gigaba s attempts to restore confidence and engage ratings agencies had failed to convince Fitch not to downgrade the country s credit rating to junk status. This should come as no surprise given that the minister is trying to convince the ratings agencies that he can hold the fiscal line and implement radical economic transformation which is simply not credible. It s not good enough for the minister to simply concede the ratings downgrade was a setback . The minister needs to roll up his sleeves and get into the fight to avoid further ratings downgrades Maynier said. He said the minister s number one priority should be to avoid the nightmare scenario where massive forced selling of the country s debt triggered an economic meltdown that would spare nobody rich or poor.This could happen if Standard &amp; Poors and Moody s downgrade SA s long-term local currency debt which made up about 90% of the country s debt to junk status . However the problem is that the ratings agencies do not trust the minister: they regarded him as a presidential minion ready to carry out any instruction no matter how damaging to the economy. To re-establish trust the minister will have to show rather than tell ratings agencies that he is serious about avoiding further downgrades by delivering quick wins starting with saying no to bailouts for zombie state-owned entities like the SABC Maynier added.
