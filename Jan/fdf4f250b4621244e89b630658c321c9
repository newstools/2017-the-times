The #FeesMustFall student leader s bail application in the High Court sitting in the Palm Ridge Magistrate's Court was successful. He had been arrested on a string of charges during the student protests. They included public violence theft and assault with the intent to do grievous bodily harm.Following his initial failed attempt to get bail last year Dlamini roped in the help of advocates Dali Mpofu and Tembeka Ngcukaitobi.Speaking after Judge Ratha Mokgoatlheng's judgment Dlamini gave his views about who should lead the ANC when president Jacob Zuma's term comes to an end in December. The front-runners are deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa and the outgoing chairperson of the African Union Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. She has the support of members of the ANC's women's league. We can't reduce leadership positions to gender. We can't do that he said. In as much as we are gender sensitive but you can't say someone must lead because of this particular gender. We are saying someone must lead because she or he is capable. Dlamini said there were many other women capable of leading the ANC including Science and Technology Minister Naledi Pandor and chairperson of the National Council of Province Thandi Modise. The best among us must lead he said. - TMG Digital
