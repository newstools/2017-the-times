Thabo Mosadi s 79th-minute strike separated the sides in a fast-paced, intense bottom-half encounter.Ajax, who at one stage could not win a game, went to 32 points and, depending the weekend s results, a place in the top eight.Chippa remain very much rooted in danger on 26 points from 27 games, three points above the playoff position.Both sides had their chances in the first half, though perhaps Ajax were the better structured team.Prince Nxumalo got on the end of a long ball out of defence early on and smashed a volley at Chippa goalkeeper Daniel Akpeyi.Mosadi was played through, forcing a low close-range stop from Akpeyi. The keeper was called on again for a fingertip save from Roscoe Pietersen s swerving free-kick.The Urban Warriors came close soon after the break, Akpeyi missing at the feet of centreback Rivaldo Coetzee, Kristopher Bergman clearing for Chippa.Lerato Manzini turned on the right and forced a one-handed, falling reflex save from Ajax keeper Brandon Petersen. Phetolo Sekome s curled free-kick tested Petersen again.Finally Mosadi latched onto a backwards header from Paseka Mako, saw a first effort parried by Akpeyi to wide on the left, and from the second attempt finished from a tight angle.- TMG Sport
