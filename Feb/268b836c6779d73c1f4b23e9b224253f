The storm has been downgraded to ex-Dineo as she makes her way towards Limpopo and Mpumalanga. South Africa is bracing for the fury of Dineo today as it shifts from battering Mozambique's coastline with howling gales and torrential downpours.What we can expect when Dineo hits Mzansi is heavy rainfall of 100mm to 200mm per day. This tropical storm got its name Dineo from the Botswana's weather bureau. Social media was buzzing with memes that will put you in stitches.#dineo ... when did she arrive in Mozambique ? pic.twitter.com/MZGygAeLMi Mongezi Malgas (@MT_Malgas) February 16, 2017#dineo ... when did she arrive in Mozambique ? pic.twitter.com/MZGygAeLMiLike Noah's Ark days you busy making jokes instead of taking safety measures for #Dineo pic.twitter.com/zysiW39jg8 BI Phakathi (@bipfilms) February 16, 2017Like Noah's Ark days you busy making jokes instead of taking safety measures for #Dineo pic.twitter.com/zysiW39jg8Limpopo we're preparing for #Dineo like pic.twitter.com/u6t3xgClr2 K0NE` (@K0NEJ) February 16, 2017Limpopo we're preparing for #Dineo like pic.twitter.com/u6t3xgClr2Our Zulu Brothers think they will stop #Dineo with their spears, when their spears failed to kill Van Damme. pic.twitter.com/iOawzEnppt IG:AdvBarryRoux (@Barry_Roux) February 16, 2017Our Zulu Brothers think they will stop #Dineo with their spears, when their spears failed to kill Van Damme. pic.twitter.com/iOawzEnpptLet's see how #Dineo reacts today pic.twitter.com/aXmpTHT5hc Keamo (@Easy_Kay_) February 16, 2017Let's see how #Dineo reacts today pic.twitter.com/aXmpTHT5hcThe saw her at Beitbridge #Dineo .... pic.twitter.com/GwCYVLKfTN Mjora Khoza (@DjMjora) February 16, 2017The saw her at Beitbridge #Dineo .... pic.twitter.com/GwCYVLKfTNI found #dineo pic.twitter.com/F9URPwRV4m Sementhlee Witbooi (@SementhleeW) February 16, 2017I found #dineo pic.twitter.com/F9URPwRV4mSo people are hoping #Dineo makes a stop at Nkandla?
