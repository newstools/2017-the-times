SuperSport United have decided not to extend Kiwi right-back Michael Boxall's contract. The club said in a statement on their official website that they will part ways with the defender‚ after negotiations to extend a two-year contract by a year could not be concluded. The statement read: "SuperSport United and New Zealand international defender Michael Boxall have parted ways with immediate effect. "Negotiations for a long-term deal with Boxall have fallen through because of the club not being able to agree terms with the defender. "The 28-year old helped Matsatsantsa to win back to back Nedbank Cup trophies in his two-year spell with over 50 games played for the club." SuperSport CEO Stan Matthews was quoted as saying: “We had an option on Michael’s contract which we did not want to exercise unconditionally. We offered him an amended option which he has declined‚ a decision which we respect. Michael served us extremely well in his time at the club - we wish him every success in his future.” Boxall did duty for New Zealand at last month's Fifa Confederations Cup in Russia‚ starting all three games against Russia‚ Mexico and Portugal. - TimesLIVE
