Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini said yesterday 188,758 of the 674,620 pupils who had registered for the exams had been recipients of a social grant.These included pupils from youth-headed households, single-parent homes, foster homes and households headed by grandparents. Of these, 95% had sat for the exams."This suggests that more than 10,000 grant recipients dropped out of school before sitting for their final exams. We commit to investigate the reasons for this dropout," she said.But those who wrote fared remarkably well, with 83% receiving a bachelor's and diploma passes, which will allow them to study at a university, college or technikon.Of these pupils, 41% achieved the sought-after bachelor's pass, which will allow them to study at university.Dlamini said with 112,000 girls making up the total number of grant recipients writing their matric exams, "the girl child continues to take all the opportunities given to her by the government"."Of most concern to us is that only 66,002 were boys. We need to be concerned about the boy child," the minister said.Dlamini said the removal of the means test to qualify for student loans through the National Student Financial Aid Scheme for social grant recipients meant that many of these pupils would be able to access higher education."There should be no hindrance in them pursuing their chosen careers," she said.
