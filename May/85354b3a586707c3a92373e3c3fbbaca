It is never-ending."In private direct messages later publicly released by Schutte Jansen said that in black culture "a women is there to pleasure" men that women tell their children it is their father s birthright to be the first and that gang rapes of babies mothers and daughters were a "pleasurable pass time".Masutha said the escalating rate of racial incidents in the country had required government to take steps including the development of the Hate Crimes and Hate Speech Bill.
