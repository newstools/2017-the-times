The National Consumer Tribunal made the finding in a ruling on Tuesday.The judgment followed an investigation by the National Credit Regulator (NCR) which found Edcon charged consumers a club fee on credit agreements. It is now settled that the charging of a club fee on credit agreements is not permitted by the NCA said Jacqueline Peters manager of investigations and enforcement at the NCR.The NCA does not allow for any other fees charges or costs to be included in a credit agreement or credit agreement documents irrespective of the nature of the charge fee or cost. This judgment provides clarity to the retailers that they should observe the closed list of fees and charges provided for in the NCA. Consumers are urged to request the quotation from their credit providers so that they can properly check the cost of credit that is being offered said Peters.The regulator will request an independent audit of Edcon s loan book to establish how many consumers must be refunded and the total amount to be refunded from 2007.A hearing date will be set by the tribunal to hear arguments on how much Edcon should be fined.
