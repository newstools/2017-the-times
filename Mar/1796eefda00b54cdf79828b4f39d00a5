City Press reported in September last year that the TV star's upmarket home was apparently back on the market.The reports emerged just a few months after Boity flaunted her new home in Centurion's Midstream Ridge Estate. Well it turns out that Boity's pad has not been sold. Speaking to Drum magazine Boity labelled the rumours as a "way to discredit her". I don t even like talking about my house. Ever since I announced it, all that people have been doing is discredit me. And the rumour that I m selling it is not true," she said.The TV personality, who confirmed her ancestral calling last year, also briefly touched on how her journey has been."It s a spiritual journey and a long one at that. I m blessed to have this gift, though people are judgmental. It s a journey. I m still learning," she told the publication.Boity announced that she had undergone training to become a sangoma in June last year."They Called. I Answered. The Proudest, most Incredible day of my life. A Beautiful Gift that I will never take for granted," she said at the time.
