In a statement issued on Wednesday Panthera the global wild cat conservation organisation called the quota arbitrary and potentially devastating for wild lion and critically endangered tiger populations and have called on the department to institute an immediate moratorium on lion bone exports.The bones are a response to the growing demand from an Asian market that has grown exponentially since 2007 when lion bones took the place of increasingly rare tiger bones.Panthera claimed that the department has agreed to institute a quota of 800 skeleton export permits per year - but early in February the department said that the export quota "was not yet finalised". A text message sent to spokesman Albi Modise to check if the situation had changed in the last month was not responded to.Dr Paul Funston senior director of Panthera s Lion Program said that the decision to establish policy that could further imperil wild lions was irresponsible. It is confounding that a country whose iconic wild lions are such a source of national pride not to mention tourist revenue would take such risks to sustain a marginal captive breeding industry that is condemned globally for its shameful practices. The legal farming of lions for tourists to bottle-feed pet and ultimately hunt in tiny enclosures is a stain on South Africa s reputation as stewards of Africa s wildlife. Panthera president and CEO Dr. Luke Hunter said that there is no evidence to show that canned hunting and legal lion bone exports take the poaching pressure off wild lion populations. In fact it is increasingly clear that these practices stimulate demand for wild lion leopard and tiger parts throughout the world. Wild lion populations are currently at 20 000 down 10 000 from two decades ago.Modise said on last month that the country had exported an average of 864 captive bred lion bones or trophies over a 10-year period but that there is "no evident suggesting that wild lion populations in South Africa are negatively affected by this trade"."The bones being exported are only from captive bred lions which consistent with CITES requirements do not have a detrimental impact on our wild lion population. Monitoring mechanisms will continue to be implemented to monitor the trade and the necessary subsequent decisions will be taken to protect the wild lion populations of South Africa " he said.- TMG Digital/TimesLIVE
