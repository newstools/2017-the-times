It's not everyday that you hear the words politician and most-liked in the same sentence. But with Fikile there definitely are exceptions. Despite being a politician Fikile has also won the hearts of many South Africans with his easy going, free-spirited nature. His love and support for SA musicians has also helped him gain major popularity among people. And let's not forget the minister can also spin a beat and burn a hole in the dance floor. Earlier this year Fikile poked fun when the annual MTV Africa Music Awards nominations were released, and he poked fun at himself, claiming that he had bagged a nod too. It was then that his alter-ego DJ Mbaweezy was born. Thanx for the nomination of the best upcoming NEVER to be heared album #MAMANominees pic.twitter.com/OlevVlfS5ZShortly after introducing Mbaweezy to the world, a video of the minister breaking it down with Tbo Touch started doing the rounds on social media. A video posted by Tbo Touch (@iamtbotouch) on Oct 6, 2016 at 8:57am PDT It was definitely one of those light-hearted moments that gave fans a glimpse of the man away from politics. And hopefully there'll be plenty more of Mbaweezy in 2017!
