It said the decision to suspend the students was taken by the university s rector and vice-chancellor Professor Wim de Villiers.The matter was investigated by SU's Equality Unit which has made recommendations to SU's Central Disciplinary Committee (CDC) and Management and the case was now a disciplinary matter the university said."The CDC will in the course of handling this matter decide on the suspensions and further steps. The case is receiving priority attention. The disciplinary process should be allowed to run its course " said De Villiers."When the matter was brought to our attention on Tuesday (9 May 2017) both Management and the SRC immediately made it clear that we strongly condemn racism and attitudes of racial supremacy."The Equality Unit reported that the posters and advertised event promoting racial polarisation/superiority combined with highly offensive references to Nazi propaganda and neo-Nazism were in breach of SU s Policy on Unfair Discrimination and Harassment. It found that the behaviour and actions of the students in question had a demeaning and humiliating impact and created an intimidating environment at SU."Stellenbosch University is doing its utmost to be a diverse and inclusive institution. The venue booking was not approved by the University and we did not have any information about the planned gathering before the posters were displayed without permission. When the matter came to our attention Campus Security was asked to remove the posters. We will continue to take a stand against racism and unfair discrimination and promote human rights equality human dignity and democracy. This we do in accordance with our own policies as well as our commitment to the Constitution of South Africa and the Bill of Rights that it enshrines " De Villiers added.
