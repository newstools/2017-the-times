Pictures posted on Facebook showed the pass resembling a mountain stream more than a road. According to the website Mountain Passes of SA: "The Swartberg Pass is for many South Africans the rubicon of gravel road passes. There is an allure and a mystique around this old pass coupled with its status as a national monument which elevates this pass to the very top of the list. It was Thomas Bain's final and best piece of road building."
