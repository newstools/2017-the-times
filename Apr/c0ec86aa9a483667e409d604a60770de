Children are selling recyclable goods to supplement their social grants to survive. Along with other reclaimers in the area, they collect paper, plastic and other material, which they sell to buy-back centres like the one owned by entrepreneur Pinky Modisane. Her centres often pay waste collectors up to R400 a day for recyclable goods. Salaminah Nchaupe, chairman of the Ntabankula Community Centre in Sebokeng, said recycling had made a great impact on the community and that included a reduction in crime."Orphans recycle and then buy food and other things they need. They are not only dependent on grant money."In the past we would have people who would steal belongings but now that they're recycling they don't need to," Nchaupe said.Modisane started her recycling company, Lindithando Waste Management, after seeing a community initiative to clean up Sebokeng in 2006. Ten years later the former policewoman became the No1 PET, or polyethylene terephthalate, plastic recycler in the country and was named PET mass recycler Petco's PETpreneur of the year for 2016.Modisane employs 16 people and recycles between 40 and 50 tons of plastic, cardboard, paper and glass each month."In 2008 I started buying from the people in the community," Modisane said. "I felt that it was unfair to just take what they collected and decided to start buying and helping the people who could not help themselves."I would give them 80c per kilogram [and] then big numbers started coming in."Figures released by Petco last month showed that South Africa had a plastic bottle recycling rate of 55% last year compared with 30% in the US. The industry recycled more than 2billion plastic bottles last year that otherwise would have ended up in landfills. Petco CEO Cheri Scholtz said even more important was the fact that the plastics recycling industry created 62000 income opportunities for collectors and reclaimers. "Petco recyclers paid out R340-million last year to waste collectors," Scholtz said.
