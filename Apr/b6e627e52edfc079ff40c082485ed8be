This view was offered by candid BidVest Wits coach Gavin Hunt in the aftermath of title-chasing United s unexpected 0-1 league defeat to bottom club Baroka at Mbombela Stadium on April Fool s Day.It was a result few would have predicted and Hunt said the setback can partly be attributed to the continuing uncertainty over Baxter s future at United. Of course the speculation can have an effect (on United) Hunt told Times Media Digital on Monday. Of course it will have an effect."You saw on Saturday and it had an effect already I think. There is always speculation and it happens all over the world. Long may it continue. Bafana have not had a coach since Ephraim Shakes Mashaba s sacking in December last year.Mashaba was fired for gross misconduct and violation of the South African Football Association s (Safa) communications policy .He still had a year left on his contract which was to run until the end of the 2018 Russia World Cup in July next year and he is challenging his dismissal at the Conciliation Mediation and Arbitration.According to Safa's own deadlines a new coach was expected to be at the helm when Bafana played international friendlies against Guinea-Bissau and Angola last month.But when that did not happen and the prolonged process started to unravel Owen da Gama was asked to step down as caretaker coach.Baxter now appears to be in the driver s seat but reports that he has allegedly told his prospective employers that he will accept the job on condition that his son is appointed as national team goalkeeper coach will have succeeded in putting Safa House under the glare of public scrutiny.Times Media Digital reported on Sunday that insiders close to the negotiations said the Briton has agreed personal terms for his second stint with the senior national team.But his acceptance of the job is allegedly on condition that his son Lee becomes the national team goalkeeper coach.Should Safa go ahead and accede to this demands they run the risk of incurring the full ire of the public and the media.Frenchman Herve Renard and Belgian Hugo Broos fell out of the race after making outrageous demands and it will be interesting to see if Safa will be willing to accommodate Baxter s own demands.The new coach is expected to be announced this week but given that the goalposts have shifted so many times over the last few weeks few will believe this until it actually happens.
