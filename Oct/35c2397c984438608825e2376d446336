Cape Town rose from third place in 2015 to become the second most popular African destination city in 2016 with 1.52-million visitors. Lagos (1.04-million)‚ Casablanca (961,694)‚ and Cairo (820,959) rounded out the top five African cities‚ while Durban remained in sixth place‚ attracting 758,057 international overnight visitors.

This indicates that Johannesburg is well positioned to be an engine of broad economic growth for the country.” Jozi's attractions for visitors was highlighted by CNN Travel last week‚ in an article headlined "Johannesburg gaining on its stunner of a sibling city"‚ saying while it could not compare with the natural beauty of Cape Town‚ it was capitalising on its urban energy and redeveloping neglected city areas into lifestyle destinations with streetlife and sidewalk restaurants‚ "creating a new life outside of the high walls that surround many suburban homes and shopping complexes". "The resulting mix of a younger generation of people has sparked a new creative life in the city's inner core that animates galleries‚ theaters and bookstores‚" the CNN report said.
