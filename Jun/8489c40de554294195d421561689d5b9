Bafana Bafana coach Stuart Baxter has said that South Africa will name a squad with an emphasis on development for the June 25 to July 9 tournament for Southern African nations.He said the core of the team will consist of SA's U-20s who exited in the first round of the U-20 World Cup in South Korea last month losing against Japan and Italy and drawing against Uruguay. Cosafa is going to be totally development. It s going to be building on that Under-20 team Baxter said. And I can t say that I don t care if we don t get good results. But I do care that we see improvement and progress and development. And I would rather see that and lose 1-0 than win 2-0 with two offside goals and play a team of 35-year-olds. And that s not to say we can t have a 35-year-old in the squad to help all the kids but the emphasis will be on development. Baxter won his first match of his second tenure as Bafana coach 2-0 against Nigeria in Uyo in Saturday s 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier.South Africa then lost 2-1 in Tuesday night s friendly against Zambia at Moruleng Stadium.Baxter who will see out his contract with SuperSport United for the remainder of this season simultaneously with taking the Bafana reins has the Nedbank Cup final against Orlando Pirates in Durban on June 24 to prepare for and oversee.Bafana last year s Cosafa champions in Windhoek have a bye into the quarterfinals where they meet the winners of Group A (Angola Mauritius Malawi and Tanzania) at Royal Bafokeng Stadium on July 2. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
