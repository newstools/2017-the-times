The singer, who recently released the single Kuwe, sings about love and its politics but he has explained that South African politics leave him infuriated."Politics are so irritating because they always [tend] to go around in circles without having an actual outcome, like a proper [tangible] outcome," he said. The singer feels that most of the laws in the South African constitution were not "created for us and by us", and he feels that most of our laws "originate from the British man"."We need to come up with our own tailor-made constitution. I don't think there is an African person in his right mind who came up with the concept a boarder posts [in Africa] for example. Someone else came up with that thing in Africa and it is used in Africa for Africans," he said.Ntando explained that while "Mandela gave us political freedom, so to speak, he did not get us financial freedom" and we are still a long way off.He added that he will always sing about love because even with all its 'politics' it is still beautiful. Making reference to things like how his new music is benchmarked off his older hits like Nguwe and Dali Wam."I think that [comparison] is inevitable. It will always be like that but I feel that as an artist I should sing what I feel and be as liberated as I can be when making my music, because that's when my music will be appreciated for what it is," Ntando said.
