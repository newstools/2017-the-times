US President Donald Trump was speaking to supporters on Saturday when he appeared to refer to the Scandinavian country as the site of a terror incident -- the latest example of his administration naming a non-existent attack.He was addressing a campaign-style rally in Florida when he launched into a list of places that have been targeted by terrorists.Trump went on to name Brussels, Nice and Paris -- European cities that have been struck by deadly terror attacks."You look at what's happening in Germany, you look at what's happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this? Sweden. They took in large numbers. They're having problems like they never thought possible," he said, provoking mockery on social media. Swedish newspaper the Aftonbladet listed everything that happened in Sweden on the night in question:Trump's speech was aimed at defending his order last month that blocked refugees and travelers from seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the United States.The order has been suspended by a federal appeals court, and Trump vowed to introduce a new order this week as a means of protecting Americans at home.Trump later tweeted that he was referencing a story from Fox News about immigration in Sweden.
