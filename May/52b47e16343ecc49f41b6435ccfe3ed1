Speaking on the Metro FM breakfast show which he co-hosts with DJ Fresh, Somizi said that while the attention was focused on Babes' hit single Wololo not winning anything, it was important to realise that it wasn't the only big song in the country."Wololo was played a lot but it wasn't the only song that was played (on radio). You have to remember timing. Babes became big at the very beginning of the year (the period in which SAMA nominations are considered) so other things happened after," he said."(Kwesta's track) Ngud was played everywhere. We played it to death at 5FM," added DJ Fresh. Somizi was reacting to the social media storm that erupted after Babes walked away with no awards at the SAMAs over the weekend.He later offered Babes some advice, encouraging her to keep making music until her "big break" came."I know how she feels because it took me a long time to be where I am today. It takes time. Babes you are just being cooked at the moment," he added.Babe took to social media after the awards to vent her anger at the awards."These awards are sold. Continue buying the awards. But it's fine, we won't starve," she said.
