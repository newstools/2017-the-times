Phiri s contract at Brondby is up at the end of June and having failed to negotiate a new deal since the parties started talking in January it seems ever more likely he will exit.But it is not what the player wants with Brondby having qualified for the UEFA Europa League next season and likely to finish in second place in the Danish league this campaign. I have been negotiating with the club for a long time about a contract and I tell them every day that this is where I want to be Phiri told Danish publication BBC.Brondby sports director Troels Bech admits it has been a frustrating time for the club and the player but has certainly not closed the door on Phiri staying with the team. It has been a rather long dance we have been talking and we have a few months to dance still. It remains to be seen [whether an agreement will be reached] Bech said.New York City operations director former USA international Claudio Reyna has denied the reports that a move for Phiri is imminent though saying there is nothing in it .Phiri joined Brondby in January 2013 from the BidVest Wits academy initially on an amateur contract but was quickly elevated to the first team and months later played a big role in helping the side avoid relegation.He has been a leading players for the side since and a key cog in their midfield making over 100 starts in all competitions including the Europa League.Phiri made his debut for Bafana Bafana in a 3-1 friendly win over Swaziland in March 2015 and also played all three games as the side won the COSAFA Castle Cup in Namibia last June. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
