Provincial police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said the councillor Sifiso Ngcobo is expected to appear in court following the shooting of Sabelo Msomi on June 4 in the Mpola area of Dassenhoek. He [the victim] was taken to hospital for medical attention. Marianhill police are investigating a case of attempted murder said Mbhele.According to a family member of Msomi - who didn't want to be named - Msomi and a friend were allegedly stopped in the Mpola area on June 4 by Ngcobo. He said three shots were fired one of which lodged in Msomi's shoulder.He said Msomi who has a heart condition was recently discharged from hospital.DA leader Zwakele Mncwango who visited the family to offer support said he was also concerned that a bribe was allegedly offered to the family after the shooting incident. We will continue to fight against this injustice he said. We further call upon the SAPS to ensure that the necessary investigations and hearings thereafter take place as it would with anyone else accused of shooting someone. The fact that the councillor is an ANC councillor should not defer from the SAPS doing their job accordingly he said. Community leaders are voted for by the residents who entrust them with the power to ensure service delivery and act in their best interests."EThekwini speaker William Lekgoa Mapena who is also the ANC regional deputy chair in eThekwini said while he has been made aware of the incident he cannot comment. There s been a case that s been opened and I can no longer comment on this issue. I will let the law take its course. I cannot also comment on the allegations made by the opposition said Mapena on Monday evening.TimesLIVE
