The US Department of State has designated South African twin brothers Tony-Lee Thulsie and Brandon-Lee Thulsie as Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs). In a statement‚ the department said the designation was under Executive Order 13224 and imposed strict sanctions on foreign persons determined to have committed‚ or who posed a significant risk of committing‚ acts of terrorism that threatened the security of US nationals or the national security‚ foreign policy‚ or economy of the United States. It said the designation sought to deny the brothers the resources they needed to plan and carry out terrorist attacks. Among other consequences‚ all of the Thulsie brothers’ property and interests in property which was subject to US jurisdiction was blocked‚ and US citizens were prohibited from engaging in any transactions with them. In July 2016‚ the Thulsie brothers were arrested during raids in South Africa for their alleged links to global terror group ISIS. At the time of their arrest‚ the twin brothers had been accused of plotting attacks targeting Jewish individuals and institutions and foreign embassies‚ including the US Embassy in South Africa. The brothers are alleged to have attempted to travel to Syria to fight for ISIS and to have recruited others to join the terrorist group. In August‚ the brothers’ case was moved from the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court to the High Court. The twins will appear in the High Court on October 20.
