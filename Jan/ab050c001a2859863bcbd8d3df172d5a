The hashtag #deadpose has dominated Twitter and Facebook since last weekend. School pupil Karabo Mnisi 19 is widely credited with having started the trend which depicts people in a variety of bloody or dead poses some humorous and some not so.Bontle Goitsimang s contribution was a video that many observers believe pushed the envelope too far. The video depicts her two-year-old daughter crying hysterically as she tried to wake her lifeless aunt sprawled on the floor with her upper body lying on some steps.The video has been viewed around the world and featured in the Daily Mail on Thursday which interviewed Goitsimang who insisted her child knew it was a joke. She knew what was going on she realised it was a joke. I think she is laughing more than crying. I was filming it it was my sister on the floor it was all planned she said.TMG Digital tried several times on Friday to contact Goitsimang.Mnisi said he expected criticism when he started the trend which he had done so for fun and to gain more followers. The matric pupil hopes to one day embark on a career featuring social media.Johannesburg-based psychologist Gregory Eccles said the video had taken the deadpose too far adding that he doubted the child knew it was a joke based on the way it was crying.He said young children have not learnt how to process death at that age and the pertinent question is whether someone sat down with the child to calm her down afterwards. Something like this can be extremely traumatising for a child and can lead to attachment problems later in life.
