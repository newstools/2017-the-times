Even if by some miracle the Lankans force the second Test into a fifth day, South Africa should still win it. Anything else would be an injustice to a home side who have outplayed their opponents.So, there was a feeling of water being tread when stumps were drawn yesterday, the third day, with the visitors on 130/4, still 377 runs away from their target of 507.South Africa have been winners- in-waiting since Tuesday, when they were 317 runs ahead at the close. They threw another 189 runs onto the pile before the declaration came 45 minutes before tea in an innings that has left questions.Two of the batsmen who could use time in the middle under minimal pressure, Hashim Amla and Temba Bavuma, were dismissed for ducks. That means they have gone 10 and six Test innings without reaching 50.Another, JP Duminy, scored 30. His last seven innings, then, have yielded only one half-century.But there will be satisfaction that the lower middle order pulled its weight, what with the last three partnerships adding 87 runs.That done, the bowlers reduced the Lankans to 69/4 before captain Angelo Mathews and Dinesh Chandimal stopped the slide.Vernon Philander struck the first blow by bowling Dimuth Karunaratne with a delivery that pitched on middle, took the inside edge and clattered leg stump.Then Philander had the hard-driving Kusal Mendis caught at third slip before Kaushal Silva fended a brutish bouncer from Kagiso Rabada to short leg.In his next over Rabada trapped Dhananjaya de Silva with a ball that would have missed leg stump.By stumps the unbroken stand between Mathews and Chandimal was worth 61, the visitors' biggest partnership of the match and their only 50 stand.Mathews was 29 not out with Chandimal on 28. Together they batted for 63 minutes and faced 88 balls. That's a fine effort, but it will have to be better if they are to deny South Africa the justice of victory.
