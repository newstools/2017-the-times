At the launch of his book Change: Organising Tomorrow Today in Durban yesterday, Naidoo said people were angry that the ANC was being used as a business opportunity."This is not the ANC I recognise or the ANC I was part of - that we would have given our lives for and fought for."Today it is seen as a party for accumulating wealth in the hands of those in power."If the ANC does not change, go back to its original principle of serving our people, then it does not deserve to be in power," said Naidoo. Commenting on calls for President Jacob Zuma to resign, Naidoo said: "The system has become so corrupt that it will take much more than the president stepping down to solve the corruption in our country."In his book Naidoo presents options for ending poverty and global warming, with a focus on organising communities.He said there was a huge trust deficit between the people in power and the growing number of discontented young people around the world."The robber barons of today are no different from the robber barons of yesterday. Although we have made progress, people have legitimate grievances about what our government is doing, what the corporate sector is doing and what trade unions are doing."We want all the leaders in all these sectors to talk about the needs of our people instead of seeing these organisations as a conveyor belt to business opportunities."
