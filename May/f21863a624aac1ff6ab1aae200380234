Safa said in a press release late on Wednesday that the national body had "finalised an agreement" with the new coach.Baxter appears set to finally fill the post which has been vacant for a staggering four months since Ephraim "Shakes" Mashaba was sacked following a disciplinary hearing in December.Baxter's club SuperSport United who play Bloemfontein Celtic in a Premier League match in Pretoria on Wednesday night had given Safa an ultimatum of until midway through this week to conclude talks that had been ongoing for the better part of a month.Belgian Hugo Broos who had led Cameroon to the Africa Cup of Nations title in Gabon in February had also declared himself available for the post.In a statement released on Wednesday evening Safa said: "Following a thorough but lengthy process of seeking a replacement Head Coach for the Men s Senior National Team Bafana Bafana the Association is pleased to announce that it has finalised an agreement with the successful candidate and is in the process of formalising the legal arrangements by exchanging signatures today (on Wednesday)."We are mindful that the South African public has been waiting with bated breath for this matter to be concluded and we can report that we will make a formal and more detailed announcement to this effect in the next 24 to 48 hours."Safa had been linked to a number of candidates in their search for a coach.Their first choice appeared to be former Real Madrid Portugal and Bafana coach Carlos Queiroz but he became tied up in his contract with Iran.Baxter would return to the Bafana job he filled with mixed success in 2004 and 2005 when the coach failed to qualify for the 2006 World Cup in Germany.In his subsequent return to South Africa the coach won two league and cup doubles with Kaizer Chiefs in 2012-13 and 2014-15.- TMG Digital/TMG Sport
