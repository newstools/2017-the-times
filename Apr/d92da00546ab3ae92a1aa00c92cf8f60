 The DA in Limpopo has contrary to some reports consulted all political parties represented in the provincial legislature for today s march against state capture in Polokwane said the DA s spokesperson in Limpopo Solly Malatsi. We are determined to continue with our fight against the crippling effects of state capture on service delivery across all spheres of government. The DA will not be distracted by nitpicking in our mission to ensure that President Zuma and all the beneficiaries of state capture fall he added.UDM leader Bantu Holomisa earlier told TMG Digital that the party did not attend the march because it was not consulted. All the other parties did not know. I heard it from the media Holomisa said.The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) which the DA in its statement on Monday said would also attend the march cited logistical issues as the reason for its non attendance.
