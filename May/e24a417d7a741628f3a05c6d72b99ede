For 70 years, the Cannes film festival has been a key event on any A-lister's calendar. But move over Nicole Kidman, there's a new breed of star in town: social media personalities invited because of their huge Instagram or YouTube followings.Sharing the red carpet with Kidman and Will Smith this week have been beauty bloggers, such as Amanda Steele, 17, (2.8million YouTube subscribers) and Swiss Instagrammer Kristina Bazan (2.4million followers).Maja Malnar, who makes a living from her blog and 264000-strong Instagram following, said years ago she started posting snaps of her daily outfits on the photo app and blogging about her travels.These days she's part of a growing industry known as "influencer marketing", whereby brands seek to harness the power of powerful web-users by slipping their products into their posts."It's a good business, I can't complain," Malnar said.The petite blonde, who is in her 20s but declined to give her age, was set to walk the red carpet on Friday in a tie-up with MasterCard and the designer who provided her dress. She'll then have to post about it."We're entrepreneurs. We saw a gap in the market and we capitalised on it," said her friend Lorna Andrews, a UK ex-air hostess who modestly calls herself a "mid-tier influencer" with 464000 Instagram followers.Cannes is no stranger to those famous for being famous - socialites like Paris Hilton have been turning up for years - and brands have long recognised the festival's power as a marketing opportunity.Top-end labels and jewellers have for decades dressed the stars free of charge at Cannes, knowing they will be snapped there by the waiting paparazzi.But the arrival of the "influencer" at the world's biggest film festival - and at international fashion weeks - is a new phenomenon.About 18 months ago Edouard Hausseguy, a 27-year-old Frenchman, realised the money-making potential of people whose photos, restaurant tips and beauty tutorials are followed by millions online, even though most would not recognise them on the street. He set up his agency Hemblem to represent anyone with a following of 30000 and up - negotiating deals with brands and then taking a cut."Those people are people like us, but they speak to millions of people with one picture," he said in an interview on a yacht moored at Cannes, where he's hoping his influencers will benefit from the presence of top brands and the media.For the festival, Hemblem has filled a villa with influencers who are splitting their time between glamorous events and furiously posting online, whether it's about designer labels or a charity for Syrian children.Co-founder Thomas Elliott said brands were catching on to the power of a recommendation from Instagrammers to shift products from the shelves.It's possible to get paid for a single post."The fee depends on the size of the following," said Joe Gagliese, co-founder of Viral Nation, a rival agency based in Toronto."It could be $100,000 if you have more than 5million followers." With 13million followers apiece, supermodels Bella Hadid and Emily Ratajkowski rank as the true Instagram queens of Cannes. Their accounts offer red carpet glamour and a peek behind the scenes, like Hadid sipping champagne while preparing for a premiere. Partner brands are carefully name-checked: make-up by Dior, jewellery by Bulgari.Further down the food chain, posts by smaller fish in the "influencer" pond still tell of a life of cocktails and beautiful clothes - but the reality may be a little less glamorous.There are constant worries of where the next event or brand tie-up might come from and some re-sell the clothes they are gifted to make ends meet.And behind the glitz there is a constant pressure to post that Andrews and Malnar say can be stressful.Neither expects to do this job forever. Women aged 18-30 make up the bulk of their followings and unless these shift there'll come a day when they won't match their young demographic.Youngsters' heavy use of Instagram is a worry for mental health experts, who warn these glimpses into the glamorous lives of others encourage depression and anxiety by prompting a "compare and despair" attitude.There's a stream of appreciative comments under posts by Hadid and Ratajkowski, but also wistful ones. Under a video of Hadid wearing custom Roberto Cavalli, a user said: "Can I just be her for one day?"
