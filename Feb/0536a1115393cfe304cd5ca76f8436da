Kwesta, who went to the awards with four nominations, left the ceremony empty handed and bitterly disappointed.Outraged fans took to social media to demand answers and made the rapper's snub one of the most talked about topics on Twitter.The usually laid-back Kwesta was not impressed at being overlooked and took to Twitter to vent his frustration.Never been a bitter fella. We keep working, we just about music. But in the end the bullshit must be called. Just got 4 missed calls from me WatchNgiyazfelaNgawe (@KwestaDaKAR) February 25, 2017 None of y'all must apologise for "failing" me bacause none of y'all did! Just know that I will never fail YOU! Haai suka as'phuze! WatchNgiyazfelaNgawe (@KwestaDaKAR) February 25, 2017 Never been a bitter fella. We keep working, we just about music. But in the end the bullshit must be called.

Riky Rick had earlier shaded the station and the awards ceremony by suggesting that some awards had been paid off. Kwesta retweeted Riky Rick's Twitter outbursts and posted a message about his situation, labelling it "the ngud, the bad and the money".Meanwhile, a number of high-profile celebs including Nandi Madida, Black Coffee, L-Tido and Culoe De Song took to social media to share their frustration at the awards and "corruption" in the music industry at the moment.Babes wodumo and Kwesta killed through out 2016 it's really sad they didn't win nothing .
