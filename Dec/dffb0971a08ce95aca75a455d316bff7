Karlien van Jaarsveld has had an eventful 2017, which included trying the knot and welcoming her two-month-old daughter, Elah with hubby Joe Breytenbach. And, on her birthday she had nothing but gratitude over her blessings.  The Afrikaans singer took to Instagram to share how happy she was on her birthday and how she couldn't ask for more.   "How much better would you like to wake up on your birthday? Thank you Lord for health and a healthy family." Karlien announced in May that she and Joe were expecting their first child together. She also confirmed that she and Joe had secretly tied the knot earlier this year. The 32-year-old's beau also took to his Instagram to wish Karlien a happy birthday and also used the opportunity to mention how amazing she is. "Congratulations on your birthday love !! It was a magic year, busy .. but magic !! You are amazing and look amazing too."
