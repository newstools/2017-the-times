This "thwarted theft" was related in the Cape Town High Court yesterday as the lawyer for murder accused Henri van Breda attempted to show that security breaches at the estate were not as rare as people would like to believe.But Marcia Rossouw, a security manager at the estate, provided details to support the state's assertion that no breaches were made on the night of January 26 2015, when Van Breda's mother Teresa, 55, father Martin, 54, and brother Rudi, 22, were hacked to death with an axe, and his younger sister, Marli, 17, was left seriously injured and fighting for her life.Rossouw painted a picture of a water-tight security system and threw cold water on the defence's assertion that an intruder was behind the murders of which Van Breda has been accused.She gave detailed technical information on the estate's security features. She said the perimeter fence was upgraded shortly before the murders. The voltage on the electric fence had been increased.She said she first realised something was wrong on the night of the murders when the police arrived at the gate of the De Zalze estate at "high speed"."We stopped them to assess the situation and then we led them to the house," she said. "I immediately gave instructions to my people to inspect every metre of the wire to make sure no one came in."We checked security camera footage and compiled certain reports with video footage," she said.She claimed that no one had breached the estate's security perimeter. Van Breda grounded for nowBut later in the day Van Breda's lawyer homed in on holes made by animals under the fence.Crossing-examining Rossouw, Pieter Botha asked her to confirm that there were holes under the fence. She said that there were, and rocks had been used to block them until repairs could be made.Judge Siraj Desai asked if this was the case on the night of the murders.Rossouw said there were holes with rocks over them but that if someone had moved them and come into the estate the alarm would have been triggered.She said her team had inspected the fence after the murders and found no evidence that the rocks had been moved.Botha said that if an object had set off the alarm when it had already been triggered, the control room in Parow would not have realised that a second breach had taken place .
