In an opinion piece written exclusively for TimesLIVEl Patel said the eight days leading up to next week s scheduled motion to table a vote of no confidence against President Jacob Zuma would be massive. Opposition parties have called for the vote to be postponed to allow the Constitutional Court to hear arguments around whether the ballot should be secret.Patel's editorial comes after he attended a chaotic memorial service on Sunday for struggle stalwart Ahmed Kathrada in Durban which was disrupted by the ANC Youth League and Patel says it is now the time to defend South Africa s hard-earned gains. Starting today we have eight days. Make them eight days that shake our beloved country. Eight days to a motion of no confidence. Eight days of encouraging each of my network to find and lobby an ANC MP. Eight days in which I will work tirelessly to persuade our own comrades. Eight days in which there is a pregnant possibility of ridding ourselves of this home-grown disaster of a State President.
