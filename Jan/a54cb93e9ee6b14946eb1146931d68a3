The ANC Women s League said Klaasen had broken the glass ceiling of the music industry and her relentless fighting spirit to achieve despite the apartheid rules and partriachy in the arts industry made her a world-renowned artist . The ANCWL will walk hand in hand with women artist to address issues of gender equality in the arts sector. No woman must be hindered to freely practise her trade said secretary-general Meokgo Matuba.Cope s Dennis Bloem said Klaasen leaves behind a rich history and we hope that the upcoming artists will be able to emulate this great music giant . She never used her voice to make money but rather to entertain and educate people and our nation he added. During the dark days of apartheid Klaasen composed songs that exposed the brutality of the regime she became a target and was constantly harassed by the police but she never gave up. We will miss her Tsotsitaal trade mark of Sophiatown. The DA s national spokesperson Phumzile van Damme said Klaasen will always be remembered acting as a guiding light for those across our country who wish to develop our country s arts and culture . We therefore encourage fellow South Africans to honour the role she played in our country by supporting our local music industry. South Africa is a country filled with talent and hope and Thandi Klaasen s story shows what we can achieve even in the most difficult of circumstances she said.The parties extended their condolences to Klaasen s family and friends.
