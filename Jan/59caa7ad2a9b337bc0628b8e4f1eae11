From orientation at the prestigious school of the arts, The Juilliard School in New York, to flying business class to Paris, Touch sure is teaching his son that the world is his oyster.And rightfully so.Touch and Ruri jetted off to the States earlier this week where they've been enjoying some quality father-son time.How lucky is this little boy?P.S. We wonder if Touch is adopting.A photo posted by Ruri Molefe (@king_ruri) on Jan 3, 2017 at 11:25am PSTA photo posted by Ruri Molefe (@king_ruri) on Dec 31, 2016 at 9:48am PSTA photo posted by Tbo Touch (@iamtbotouch) on Jan 3, 2017 at 7:35am PSTA photo posted by Tbo Touch (@iamtbotouch) on Jan 3, 2017 at 12:37am PST
