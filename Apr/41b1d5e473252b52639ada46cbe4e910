A local YouTuber decided to ask the question through a social experiment on the streets of Cape Town.He walked past people on the streets and dropped a bag of flour that resembled cocaine on the floor.Some of the reactions were hilarious! Like the guy who jumps at the bag and then rode off into the sunset in a taxi.
