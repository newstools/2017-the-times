The voracious larval pest has been identified throughout Limpopo and in northern Gauteng and could ruin the entire country's maize harvest if not contained.The migratory worms native to South and Central America also attack sorghum soybeans groundnuts and potatoes. The department realises that transboundary pests and diseases especially migratory pests threaten food security and that coordinated efforts are important to address these risks Minister Senzeni Zokwana told journalists at a media briefing in Pretoria on Monday.The fall armyworm is new to South Africa meaning no pesticide has been registered for use and proven successful in fighting it.An ongoing emergency process has now registered two pesticides which are likely to work if used correctly. As with all agricultural remedy applications the label instructions must be followed in accordance to the supplier's recommendations Zokwana said.The department is extending its programme to farmers in other provinces with awareness campaigns and further tests for indentifying the presence of the worm. Pheromone traps will be imported into South Africa to determine the exact extent of the spread and the specific strain of fall armyworm present in South Africa. Zokwana urged the nation to remain calm saying that the pesticides identified are safe for use. We will ensure that no residue can affect South Africans [through their food consumption]. The department met with the National Treasury earlier on Monday to ask for funding to assist the farming community.It has also started a plant pest action group made up of provincial agriculture departments researchers and producer associations in the industry to evaluate its progress in curbing the worm's spread weekly.Zokwana could not say what the impact of the fall armyworm has been in South Africa thus far but that the department is acting quickly to minimise damage.The worm was positively identified by the department last week though farmers had reported it earlier.Departmental spokesperson Bomikazi Molapo said the two pesticides cleared for use are readily available to farmers as they are already in use in the country though they were not registered for use against the fall armyworm.Zokwana will visit some of the areas affected by the worm on Friday.
