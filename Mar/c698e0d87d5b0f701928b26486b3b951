Its claims about the danger of the chemical glyphosate in our food have just been researched.The final word is the claims are unlikely to be true but "difficult to reject entirely" according to Africa Check. Why is South Africa poisoning its people? asked Mangosuthu Buthelezi the leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) in a statement released late last year. This was after the party lodged a complaint with the South African Human Rights Commission. Their complaint included a number of claims about genetic modifications to maize and soya and their effect on human health. But they specifically zeroed in on a chemical called glyphosate.Glyphosate is sprayed on commercially grown food crops that are genetically engineered to resist its effects. So while spraying it with glyphosate kills weeds it does not kill the crops. RoundUp is the most common brand name under which glyphosate is sold in South Africa.The IFP wrote that because the World Health Organisation classified glyphosate as probably carcinogenic (cancer-causing) South Africa is feeding its people toxins thus feeding the cancer pandemic .Researcher Vinayak Bhardwaj on behalf of Africa Check set out to investigate if the chemical contributed to cancer in humans and if so if glyphosate occurred at high enough levels in South Africa s food crops to likely cause cancer.Africa Check reported that while the World Health Organisation s cancer agency stated that glyphosate was possibly carcinogenic based on studies of individual people exposed to the chemical a comprehensive review of studies looking at its effect on animals and humans later found that glyphosate was unlikely to cause cancer.South Africa s department of health limits the amount of glyphosate to less than 2 mg/kg in maize and 10 mg/kg in soya roughly half of what the internationally accepted maximum limits are. However the health department generally does not see the potential harm from glyphosate as a high priority risk and therefore only conducts tests from time to time.When the department s forensic chemistry laboratory tested 40 samples of maize meal in 2012/13 no glyphosate was detected the director of forensic pathology services at the department of health Alida Grove told Africa Check.However the department of agriculture forestry and fisheries Thilivali Nepfumbada said the department does not check for glyphosate in maize or soya sold to consumers because that is beyond our mandate and is a food safety issue .Africa Check's conclusion was that the claims were unlikely to be true - with this proviso: "Still without regular testing and publicly available information about glyphosate levels in food the claim that South Africa may be 'feeding its people cancer-causing toxins' is difficult to reject completely".
