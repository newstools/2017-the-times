Not even his heavily armed bodyguards could protect him from a group of Hawks officers when they picked him up on the N2 near Mthatha yesterday.He was served with both an arrest and search warrant.National Hawks spokesman Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi said the outspoken municipal manager was arrested by members of a special task team formed by the Hawks in Pretoria.The task team was established to investigate what the Hawks termed as worsening corruption in three Eastern Cape municipalities including Mnquma.The Eastern Cape municipal area he serves includes Butterworth.Tantsi will appear in the town's magistrate s court this morning. He spent last night in custody after his lawyer failed to secure his release.Although details of his alleged crimes will be revealed in court when the municipal manager applies for bail the Daily Dispatch reported that it has reliably been informed that Tantsi s arrest relates to a R10-million tender Mnquma issued two years ago.A company won a tender to supply the municipality with refuse bags. It is alleged the prices of the rubbish bags were inflated to the point where a packet of 20 was sold to the municipality at a cost of between R185 and R192 when they only retail for about R20 to R30.Of the R10-million the company received more than R2- million was paid to three people with code names as a form of alleged kickbacks.- TMG Digital/Daily Dispatch
