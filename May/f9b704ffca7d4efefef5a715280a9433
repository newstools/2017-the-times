Bieber was staying at the One&amp;Only in Cape Town when he started a live video to chat to fans.He said his friends had left him and he was bored in his hotel room.He took his fans through his fridge (there was even All Gold on the shelf) his toiletries and sang.But probably the funniest part was when he started knocking on doors at the hotel where he was staying.Security at the hotel is tight but even Bieber tried to dodge the beefy guards to prank fellow guests.Watch the video here (Skip to the 36 minute mark to watch the pranks)
