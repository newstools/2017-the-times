In the end a boycott of an official send off function attended by the country s acting president and several cabinet ministers and a weekend of lost training has forced an agreement that is supposed to see the players get to share the money that Zimbabwe are to be paid for their participation in the tournament which starts in Libreville on Saturday.An agreement for a payment of US$5 000 per game (around R69 000) has been signed although there must be some sceptism that the players will ever see the money.The Zimbabwe Football Association (Zifa) have pledged to pay the money by Thursday failure to which the players have threatened to boycott the tournament which starts on Saturday.The players are also pressing for a $6 000 winning bonus.The football association were offering the footballers $500 (R6 900) in appearance fees and $50 (R700) in local daily allowances and $150 (R2 000) in foreign daily allowances.Players did receive $1 500 (some R20 000) each in lieu of daily allowances before climbing onto flights to Addis Ababa on Sunday which would take them to Cameroon for Tuesday s friendly against the Indomitable Lions.Katsande led a boycott of Friday night s gala dinner as players stayed in their hotel rooms and then tried to negotiate with the sports minister and Zifa.Continuing with the chaos that has plagued Zimbabwe's preparations Katsande's former Kaizer Chiefs teammate Mathew Rusike who last week signed for a club in Tunisia was accused by Zimbabwean newspapers of swearing at Zifa officials.Rusike tweeted in response to the allegation in the Zimbabwe press: Nobody enjoys the truth when a lie is more entertaining .Katsande told local reporters that the labelling of the players as mercenaries was unfair. We are asking for what we think we deserve and some people call us that (mercenaries) " he said."I think that is very unfair."And if we want to be honest the $5 000 we are asking falls far short of what other players from other nations are getting. A team like Togo is giving its players something like $25 000 a match in appearance fees."From what we hear from our colleagues from other countries we actually asked for less than what they are getting. Some players here actually received calls from their friends who play in other countries when our contract document was leaked and published on the internet."They are actually laughing at us that we are getting peanuts but we understand our situation and we have accepted it Katsande said. - TMG Digital
