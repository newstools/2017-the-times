It was on March 5 2013 almost four years ago to the day that Swallows won 1-0 with a Siyabonga Nomvethe penalty at Atteridgeville to complete the double over Sundowns having beaten them 2-0 at home at Dobsonville earlier in the season.Defending champions Downs have lost only twice in the league this season as they push on towards retaining their title.Their first defeat came at the hands of City at Loftus Versfeld in October and their second on their last trip to the Mother City when Ajax Cape Town beat them at the end of November.City host Sundowns at Athlone Stadium on Friday night seeking to achieve the double although their coach Eric Tinkler insisted this week his side were underdogs and had nothing to lose even though they share the leadership of the PSL table. There is no pressure on us. We have done extremely well to find ourselves where we are and we have got to where we are through a lot of hard work he said. And if we can continue doing that knowing that there is no pressure the result will come. I told my players you have an opportunity to go out there express yourselves attack. You ve got nothing to lose and if you win the game then you are sending a signal out there that we have quality at Cape Town City and that we mean to finish as high as we can in the league added Tinkler whose team are in a maiden season and have already won the Telkom Knockout.The City coach said he did not expect any surprises from Sundowns tactically saying that Brazilians coach Pitso Mosimane might change some personnel but not the way he will approach the game. There are so many things he can do but tactically they play the same way irrespective of who the team is. We have to prepare ourselves the correct way and for the individual capabilities of some of the players Tinkler said.Mosimane has had little time to prepare after Tuesday s match 0-0 draw against Chippa United at Loftus Versfeld spilled over into Wednesday when there was a power outage in Pretoria.- TMG Digital/TMG Sport
