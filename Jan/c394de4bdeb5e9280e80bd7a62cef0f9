A major trophy even.But what do they not want to see?Here s our five best guesses:1. Indian arrogance Under Virat Kohli s captaincy India have become the most insufferably self-important team in the game.Wouldn t it be awful if they came to South Africa next summer and earned the right to swagger by winning the test series?2. Australia advancing fair Having smacked the Aussies 5-0 in a one-day series and beaten them 2-1 in a test rubber last year the last thing South Africa need is for the uber competitive bastards to come here next season and even the score.3. Hashim s horrors Few players have had so large and lasting an impact on any team that Hashim Amla has had on South Africa on as well as off the field.He s been a great for several years now and he will never lose that status.Nonetheless it s going to hurt if his current dry spell goes on for much longer.4. Dale s dodgy bits The same goes for Dale Steyn whose very presence on the field lifts South Africa and turns them into a far better team.But Steyn s serious injuries - three last season - are a worry.Here s hoping the only doctor he sees once he gets back into the side is when he takes his dogs to the vet for a check-up.5. AB anguish Who wouldn t want a fit and firing AB de Villiers in their XI? Fine.But where do you put him if the XI is winning?And South Africa are winning convincingly.They don t want their players to feel as if they have to look over their shoulder to see if De Villiers is lurking.It s enough to make you wish some poor bugger is in bad enough form to be dropped when the decision needs to be made. - TMG Digital
