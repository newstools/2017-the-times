Hundreds of them marched to the Transport Department in Pretoria yesterday, demanding the expulsion of popular ride-hailing service Uber.Earlier at Rosebank Gautrain station in Johannesburg metered taxi drivers carrying knobkerries swept through the precinct recruiting others to join them in the #UberMustFall protests.The three-wheeled tuk-tuks at the station have also become a target of the operators."If you fail to stop them we're going to stop them ourselves," they shouted after handing over their memorandum of demands to the department.Metered taxi operators in the country's cities have been up in arms against Uber for many months now.They argue the Uber drivers are putting them out of business.Johannesburg metered taxi operators joined forces with their Pretoria counterparts for yesterday's march.The march began at the Marabastad bus terminal.Under the watchful eye of police the operators sang protest songs outside the transport department building before marching back to Marabastad peacefully.Read by marcher Mang-Mang Nkadimeng, the memorandum said Uber and the tuk-tuks were operating illegally."Uber, a foreign company, is allowed to bully us as people of this country," said Nkadimeng.Their memorandum gave the department 14 working days to act.EFF and Black First Land First supporters joined the march.Earlier, security guards at the Rosebank Gautrain station said the armed taxi drivers jumped out of a minibus and started harassing other metered taxi drivers and took the taxi signs off their vehicles.Holding a poster bearing the word "Taxi" just outside the station, Thomas Dube said violence against drivers had been escalating, but protesting against them would not be of much use as Uber was here to stay."They say if you can't beat them, join them. But meter taxi drivers can't be accommodated at Uber because our cars are too old and we can't afford the new ones," said Dube.
