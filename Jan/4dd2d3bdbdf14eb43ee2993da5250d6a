Moosa said even if Sundowns genuinely made a mistake, their failure should not prevent Dolly's move to French club Montpellier or Greek side Olympiacos.Montpellier and Olympiacos have both put in R14-million offers for the player.Moosa said any attempt to block a European move for Dolly in the current January transfer window would be poor treatment of a player who has served with dedication."I know Sundowns are a club, especially since [president] Patrice Motsepe took over, who look after their players well financially. But I think Keagan is ready to go overseas. He's played at all levels now except the World Cup. He's played in the Olympics, he's made a mark with the Sundowns team that became champions of Africa. And even through this [dispute] process he hasn't showed that it's affected his play. He's continued in a professional way, in terms of his performances and even his attitude."Dolly has been taken to the Premier Soccer League's Dispute Resolution Chamber (DRC) to dispute a R12-million buyout clause in the Bafana Bafana winger's contract.Downs have claimed changes to the clause, made when the player renewed the contract 17 months ago, were a mistake.The heads of argument on the case at the DRC were presented on December 9, with an outcome pending. Sundowns general manager Sizwe Nzimande and legal and commercial manager Yogesh Singh could not be reached for comment. - TMG Digital
