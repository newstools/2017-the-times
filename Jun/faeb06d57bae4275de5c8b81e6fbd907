During an interview on Real Talk with Anele Mdoda, Khanyi couldn't contain her excitement and pride. "For the first time in my life, I bought myself a sports car without the help of any man," she said. Khanyi described the feeling as the proudest moment of her life. The confirmation comes just weeks after Khanyi shared a picture of herself posing next to the sexy, navy-blue beast of a car. At the time it was not clear if the car belonged to Khanyi or not.
