 It was already one of the Western Cape towns most affected by the current province-wide water shortages - and supply has now been severely affected by fire damage and related power failures said local government and environment MEC Anton Bredell. More than 500 houses were burnt and 7000 people evacuated as ravaging fires hit Knysna this week said SANParks spokesperson Nandi Mgwadlamba adding that rain along the Garden Route was not enough to bring relief to the towns hit by the fires. Knysna is still a community in tears this morning after the devastation caused by the fires two nights ago she said. Sounds of the Oryx flying over the Knysna estuary part of the Garden Route National Park were the first sounds heard this morning. The winds have died down and choppers can now fly to extinguish left-over flames. Our prayers and thoughts go out to colleagues stakeholders and families whose houses were burnt down.
