Lee, vice-chairman of Samsung, would be quizzed as a "suspect" in connection with bribery, prosecutors said.The affair centres on Park's secret confidante Choi Soon-sil, who is accused of using her ties to Park to coerce top firms into "donating" tens of millions of dollars to two non-profit foundations that Choi then used as her personal ATMs. Samsung was the biggest contributor to the foundations. It is also accused of giving millions to Choi to bankroll her daughter's equestrian training in a bid to curry favour.Prosecutors have for months questioned Lee and other senior Samsung officials. The officials reportedly argued that although they were coerced to offer money, they sought no favours in return and thus the payments were not a bribe.Prosecutors are investigating whether Samsung bribed Choi in order to win state approval for a controversial merger it sought in 2015.The merger of two Samsung group units - Cheil Industries and Samsung C&amp;T - was seen as a crucial step towards ensuring a smooth third-generation power transfer to Lee Jae-Yong. It was criticised by many, who said it wilfully undervalued Samsung C&amp;T's stocks. But the National Pension Service , a major Samsung shareholder, voted in favour of the deal and it eventually went through.Prosecutors have raided multiple Samsung offices as well as the NPS in connection with the scandal. The fund is overseen by the welfare ministry. A former welfare minister was arrested last month for allegedly pressuring NPS officials to vote in favour of the Samsung deal.
