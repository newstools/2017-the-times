Many people say it is probably the best time to play Pirates but I beg to differ with that Manyama said.The forward warned that it will be a battle to facing a wounded Pirates. After what happened over the weekend they will be a very dangerous side to face he said. We have to give them the respect they deserve and we have to be very careful of them. It is very dangerous to play them when they are in such a state and it won t be easy. I prefer to play them when they come from a few wins.
