 I will refuse to visit the United States. Other people can visit but I ... have no interest in visiting the United States while he is the president Meyer told The Times amid worldwide protests against Trump s travel ban on people from seven Muslim-dominated countries.In the UK more than 1.6 million people have signed a memorandum demanding that a state visit by Trump later this year be cancelled.Part of Meyer s job as Western Cape finance MEC is to attract foreign investment and the US is one of the country s biggest trade partners.Meyer is also the DA deputy federal chairman responsible for the party s international relations.In September City of Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille went on a nine-day trip to the US visiting Atlanta Newark New York Los Angeles and San Francisco with two officials in a bid to attract investment.The trip was organised with Wesgro the Western Cape government s agency to promote trade and investment.Asked how his statement would affect the province and Cape Town s efforts to increase trade with the US Meyer said he would not stop anyone else visiting the country. That is the biggest economy in the world and Cape Town is [always] open for business he said. As a minister of finance our job is always to look to grow the economy and create jobs and that will continue to be. But Trump was a racist who hated black people Muslims and any people who did not look like him. I don t think he has any good news for Africans at all. He has no plans to facilitate economic trade between the US and the African continent like (ex-president Barack) Obama did said Meyer.-TMG Digital/TimesLIVE
