The Board drew attention to the Cybercrimes and Cybersecurity Bill as an assault on the right to digital privacy and a threat to the protection of journalists sources while it also supported ongoing efforts to challenge the 2002 Regulation of Interception of Communications and Provision of Communication-related Information Act.The board also denounced the draft Prevention and Combating of Hate Crimes and Hate Speech Bill which would criminalise "bringing contempt and ridicule" onto figures of authority as well as the Film &amp; Publication Board Amendment Bill which broadens state power to censor content.It noted that the controversial Secrecy Bill could still be signed into law after Parliament recommended President Jacob Zuma give it his final approval despite vigorous opposition from media and civil society groups."WAN-IFRA has expressed its deep concern that the government is considering a range of measures that will intimidate the press promote self-censorship and silence criticism. In order to address the shrinking space for independent journalism WAN-IFRA has urged the South African authorities to adopt a more open inclusive approach to dialogue and to work with media legal and civil society organisations to craft legislation that seeks to enable rather than restrict a more positive environment for freedom of expression."The full text of the resolution can be viewed here.WAN-IFRA met in Durban last week an event attended by media from around the world.During its meeting in Durban the WAN-IFRA board also passed six other press freedom resolutions calling on global solidarity for media facing extreme challenges in Botswana Cameroon Tanzania Zambia Mexico and Turkey.The resolutions can be read at:- WAN-IFRA Board Resolution Botswana- WAN-IFRA Board Resolution Cameroon- WAN-IFRA Board Resolution Tanzania- WAN-IFRA Board Resolution Zambia- WAN-IFRA Board Resolution Mexico- WAN-IFRA Board Resolution TurkeyWAN-IFRA is the World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers.
