Scheffler a Stellenbosch-based physiotherapist and extraordinary lecturer at the Centre for Rehabilitation Studies at the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences Stellenbosch University received close to half a million rand through the Discovery Health Rural Fellowship Award to help her design and test a home-based rehabilitation programme that empowers community health workers to deliver rehabilitation services at the primary health care level. She is doing her PhD through the Department of Family and Emergency Medicine."Most stroke survivors do not receive any rehabilitation services and often their caregivers have not received any training on how to care for them as stroke survivors typically have high levels of dependency " Scheffler explains."The lack of training of caregivers combined with the limited capacity of district rehabilitation services and the contextual barriers limiting access to rehabilitation services perpetuate the stroke survivor's dependency and the burden on caregivers and the health care system."The 530 community health workers in the Cape Winelands where she is conducting her research have not received any training in rehabilitation.There are only 13 rehabilitation professionals in the district and no primary level stroke rehabilitation programmes.For her PhD Scheffler designed a programme to supplement the skills of community health workers to include basic rehabilitation training which they could transfer to family caregivers of stroke survivors. Stellenbosch University said her rural fellowship award is enabling her to test the viability of this programme."I would like to see rehabilitation being better integrated and delivered more appropriately within the primary health care and district health system context to reach all those in need and not only a select few. Considering the paucity of research in the area and the lack of appropriate programmes there is a need to develop appropriate models of service delivery focussed rehabilitation programmes for the primary level and to support of the roles of the rehabilitation professional " says Scheffler.Once finalised the rehabilitation programme and training resources will be available as a free online resource which can be downloaded modified for context and used as a free-standing programme or integrated into other programmes for community health workers.
