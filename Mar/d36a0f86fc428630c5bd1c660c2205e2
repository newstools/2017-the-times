Minister of Sport and Recreation, @MbalulaFikile should fire Communications Manager @EsethuHasane for this racist comment! pic.twitter.com/72OP0Nt2vvEsethu Hasane posted on Twitter and Facebook on Monday.Hasane is the media and communications manager of the Department of Sport and Recreation. The fact that three days have passed and the minister has not fired Hasane or taken any action for that matter means that he either shares this racist view or condones it DA MP Darren Bergman said in a statement on Thursday. This would seem to contradict the minister s previous views on racism and sport. Responding to racists comments made last year he said that racists have no place in our society and must be isolated as they take us backwards . - TMG Digital
