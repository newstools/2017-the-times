According to myzimbabwe.co.zw, Dr Nyasha Masuka said the boy sustained injuries and subsequently spent two days in hospital for treatment.He was allegedly mocked by his friends who said he was not going to attract girls because he was not circumcised. It seems the other boys were laughing at him for not being circumcised so he used a machete to circumcise himself," said Dr Masuka.Dr Masuka said he did not understand why the teenager tried to circumcise himself when voluntary male circumcision teams visit his home area regularly.
