While Mabala Noise have remained tight-lipped on the rumours word is that the stable has big things in store. Mabala Noise spokesperson Mhlo Gumede told TshisaLIVE that everything "will make sense soon". In due time it will all make sense whether they are signed with Mabala Noise or not. We are not saying they are signed and we are not saying they are not signed, right now there no negotiations, they have either happened or are still going to happen," he said. Speculation has been rife ever since a poster promoting Kelly Khumalo ahead of the Metro FM Awards was released. The poster seemed to have let the cat out the bag, but Mhlo remained guarded. "Take it like this, right now there s a poster with Kelly and Mabala Noise logos, that s all I can say. People must just wait for the 25th of February (Metro FM Music Awards) for a big announcement," he added. Kelly Khumalo also shot down the rumours. "These rumours have been going around forever. Mabala Noise is family to me, I've been there since the start and they will always be family. So no, I'm not signing to Mabala Noise," she said. This comes just a day after insiders told us that the stable was apparently hoping to meet with disgraced rapper Molemo 'Jub Jub' Maarohanye to discuss a possible record deal. An insider said that Jub Jub's manager had approached the statement but they were still in the process of setting up a meeting. Mabala Noise would neither confirm or deny the claims.
