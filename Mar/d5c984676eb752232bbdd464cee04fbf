The calm assured Swede has swaggered into his job without any real sign of insecurities guiding Bucs to a 1-1 Absa Premiership draw against Polokwane City at Orlando Stadium in his first official match on Saturday.Now in his second game Jonevret faces the biggest match on the South African sporting calendar even if it has been tarnished by conservative football and low scorelines in recent years as Bucs line-up for one of the world's biggest football derbies against Kaizer Chiefs. Maybe it could be positive that I don t really know what I m going into " Jonevret said on Thursday."I m not so stressed two days before the game. I'm working as normal. I try to prepare the players as normal."Had I been down this two or three times I could maybe be a bit nervous. It could be a positive thing," Jonevret pointed out that he's no stranger to derbies. But even if I haven't been in the Soweto derby I have played a lot of derbies " he said."I coached in Stockholm in the capital of Sweden and we have two or three big teams there even if the arena is maybe a maximum of 50 000 or 60 000. Those games are special and the winner there walks around for a few weeks while the loser stays at home with mama. So I have been a little bit in this situation before and I know a bit about it. Jonevret (54) is coaching his first team outside Scandinavia.His previous clubs include Djurgardens with whom he won a Swedish league and cup double in the mid-2000s and most recently Viking FK in Norway. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
