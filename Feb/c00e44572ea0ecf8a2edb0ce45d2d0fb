It has been a difficult couple of months for Ayanda Ncwane - wife to late Gospel star Sfiso Ncwane - who has been learning to live without Sfiso.She has been writing heartfelt messages on Instagram and has slowly been trying to get back to normal. On Sunday, she went down memory lane as she celebrated what would have been the couples' 10 anniversary of the day she said "yes"."It was this particular day in 2007 when i finally said YES... I will... But he didn't bring the ring cos he could not afford it...but shame he brought the camera guy." She added that Sfiso explained that he does not have money but he planed to marry her that year.She went on to declare her undying love and added that although God had different plans for them, she will always love her husband.Here are 5 times the Ncwane's gave us #LoveGoalsA post shared by Sfiso ncwane (@sfisoncwane) on Oct 13, 2016 at 5:56am PDTA post shared by Ayanda Ncwane (@ayandancwane) on Sep 18, 2016 at 10:28pm PDTA post shared by Ayanda Ncwane (@ayandancwane) on Aug 12, 2016 at 5:46am PDTA post shared by Ayanda Ncwane (@ayandancwane) on Dec 30, 2015 at 1:42pm PSTA post shared by Ayanda Ncwane (@ayandancwane) on Nov 22, 2015 at 9:46am PST
