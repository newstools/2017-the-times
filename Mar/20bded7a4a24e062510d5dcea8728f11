The audience in the Artscape foyer in Cape Town rose to its feet to acknowledge 74-year-old s performance with the Cape Philharmonic under the baton of resident conductor Brandon Phillips. I must confess I got a little bit of the butterflies while sitting there and my hands started shaking Dreyer said after the lunchtime concert. But when I started it was OK. As an 18-year-old piano prodigy Dreyer auditioned to play the same Mozart concerto with the Cape Philharmonic in 1960. While my audition was a success the laws of the time were against me he said. He told TimesLive on Tuesday: One can easily give up because of circumstances and I think one should persevere before you can achieve your goal. I m really glad that I could eventually do it I m really grateful. I wouldn t like to go through it again though that kind of pressure. Dreyer retired as a full-time music teacher in 1993 but works part-time in choir training and jazz at South Peninsula High School in Diep River. - TMG Digital/The Times
