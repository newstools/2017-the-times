It is with the deepest and most heartfelt sympathy that our thoughts go out to those whom have lost loved ones in the Knysna fires and severe weather in Cape Town. Our thoughts too are with those residents especially the destitute and vulnerable who have been displaced and left exposed in the affected areas said Ben Kruger CEO of Standard Bank Group.
