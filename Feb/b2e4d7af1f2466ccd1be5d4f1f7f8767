That was the word from president Mark Alexander on Friday.The review process started last December after the Springboks lost eight of their 12 Tests in Coetzee s first season in charge.In a brief statement SA Rugby said: All the work around the coach review process had been concluded but that the Union can t make any comment on the process until all the contractual negotiations had been completed. SA Rugby have to deal with all relevant matters before making any announcements on the outcomes which will happen as soon as possible. A well-placed source confirmed to TimesLIVE a two weeks ago that Coetzee was to stay in the job at least until after the June series against France.The statement s referral to contractual negotiations being completed is intriguing which suggests that at the very least would be some backroom reshuffling.It appears that backline coach Mzwandile Stick will be sidelined but not necessarily sacked with Cheetahs coach Franco Smith taking over backline duties.The source also said that former Bok centre Brendan Venter could act as a more permanent consultant as part of the actions that Alexander referred to in an earlier statement last month.TimesLIVE has also learned that one option on the table is to appoint Coetzee as SA Rugby high performance manager after the June series against the French. It was the position left vacant by Rassie Erasmus last July when he departed to take up the director of rugby role with Irish province Munster.That could be a smart solution because SA Rugby would not have to pay Coetzee out. The Bok is a good organiser and well liked who could work well as a link between SA Rugby and the provinces.His presentations at last year s coaching indaba were well received for their technical detail.It would also buy SA Rugby some time to headhunt a new Bok coach in the coming weeks with Erasmus still in line to over in time for the Rugby Championships.
