When South Africans marched under the leadership of the opposition parties at the National Day of Action ... I advised that we cannot march forever but that we must find a way to converge under one roof to discuss South Africa s future said Holomisa.He said his party is of the view that there must be a vehicle that will provide a safe space for all stakeholders irrespective of political affiliation to assemble and hammer out a common vision for South Africa. South Africa is at a crossroad and is in urgent need of visionary leadership who provides guidance in finding lasting solutions to the challenges we face. The uprisings as expressed through peaceful marches reflect a deep-seated frustration about the direction the country is taking he said.Holomisa was one of the political leaders who organised last week s march by political parties to demand that Zuma leave office.
