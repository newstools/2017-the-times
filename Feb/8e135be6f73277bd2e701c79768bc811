That [the packed schedule] is why we need a coach and we need somebody who has a proven track record at the highest level and who understands what it takes to compete on the global stage the Safa president said. We have decided to head hunt the coach who will take us forward and we will be announcing a committee on Tuesday or Wednesday that will include Lucas Radebe Neil Tovey and football legend [Buti] Buddha Mathate to conduct the interviews. Jordaan said Safa will also be making an announcement regarding the new Banyana Banyana coaching as the position was that has been left vacant by the departure of Vera Pauw. Desiree Ellis has filled the role in a caretaker capacity. Banyana Banyana must qualify for the 2018 Africa Cup of Nations and the 2019 World Cup and the coach who is going to take over must know what we want out of the team Jordaan stressed.Safa chief executive Dennis Mumble said that the association have received 32 unsolicited CV s from coaches around the world about the vacant Bafana Bafana job but they have contacted spoken to anyone.Among the experienced coaches to have sent CVs are former Egypt coach Hassan Shehata Italians Roberto Mancini and Giovanni Trapattoni and former Nigeria coach Samson Siasia. We have received all these CV s and we want to make it clear that they are all unsolicited and we have not spoken to anyone about the Bafana Bafana job said Mumble.Jordaan said four other coaches who have shown interest in the job but declined to reveal their identities as they are still contracted elsewhere.Safa s president added that the Caf (Confederation of African Football) executive will be in SA for the Super Cup between Mamelodi Sundowns and TP Mazembe on Saturday. The match takes place at Loftus Versfeld and not Lucas Moripe Stadium in Atteridgeville as earlier announced to cater for the international status of the game.Next week the Fifa International Executive Summit will also be held in the country between February 21 and 23.- TMG Digital/TMG Sport
