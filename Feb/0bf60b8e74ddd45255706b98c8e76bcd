They're eagerly awaiting his arrival home after his younger sister Nosiphiwo Shiyani 20 identified him in an article on TimesLive on Monday week.According to Nosiphiwo the family did not suspect anything on the day Shiyani left their home in King Williams Town Eastern Cape. He told us he is going to Grahamstown which was his regular thing to do but this time he did not return. We searched for him with no luck. I could not believe my eyes when I saw him on social media. I am relieved that he is alive. Nosiphiwo went to the local Tamara police station in King Williams Town where a Constable Nomsebenzi Mdoda helped her reach TimesLive.Arrangements are being made to safely transport Shiyani back home and reunite him with his family. He has been living in his cranny for the past two months ever since he arrived in Johannesburg. His mental illness has always been manageable and we did not think he would disappear. I was scared of losing my mother over the distress she suffered. He does not have a wife or children but he left us and his friends in dismay said NosiphiwoWhen TimesLive found him tucked away with a few possessions in his hole Shiyani said "I wake up at 2pm and walk to the filling station with my two-litre bottle to fetch water to bath by the corner. Then I buy food and around 3pm I listen to Radio Sonder Grense until it's time to get back to my spot at 6pm."I miss home especially waking up to Morvite Weetbix and Jungle Oats for breakfast. I miss my mother and my two sisters who I left behind when I took a bus to the city " he said. - TMG Digital
