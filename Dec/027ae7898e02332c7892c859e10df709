While the future of star Mamelodi Sundowns midfielder Khama Billiat remains uncertain‚ coach Pito Mosimane can sleep a lot easier after the club completed the contract extensions of several other key players. Sundowns have announced that they have extended the contracts of Kennedy Mweene‚ Motjeka Madisha‚ Themba Zwane and Siyanda Zwane. Goalkeeper Mweene‚ defender Madisha and midfielder Zwane have played a vital role in Sundowns’ ascension to the top of the PSL standings at the halfway mark while Siyanda Zwane has been a peripheral figure this season. Mosimane said this week renewing the contracts of key players and adding a few new faces to boost the squad was high on his agenda ahead of the Caf Champions League in the new year. “This is a period where other players have to go and others come in‚" he said. "As I have already told you‚ we are strengthening the team. "For us‚ January is six weeks before the star of the Champions League and we have to bring in a few players. "It is not easy because the players that we bring must acclimatise‚ but we will probably bring in two from the outside‚” said Mosimane.
