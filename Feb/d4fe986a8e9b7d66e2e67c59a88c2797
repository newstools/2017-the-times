First half goals from Gabadinho Mhango were enough for the Students, who have moved back to the top of the log on goal difference.Pirates have not won in their last seven league matches dating back to their 1-0 win away to Chippa United on November 22.They also lost their unbeaten home record this season even though they showed a bit more fight than their half-dozen capitulation at Loftus Versfeld on Saturday afternoon.They also finished the game with 10 men after goalkeeper Jackson Mabokgwane was sent for handling the ball outside the box after some shambolic defending that has become Pirates trademark.Mhango's two goals in the 29th and 45th minute painted a picture of Pirates' dereliction of their defensive duties.Mhango waltzed past Happy Jele and Thabo Matlaba before unleashing a right footed curler past the helpless Mabokgwane.The headed goal from a Phakamani Mahlambi corner in referee's optional time exposed Pirates' tall timbers in Ayanda Gcaba and Jele in terms of positioning.While cricket teams who have dropped their heads during a game are visible in their fielding and running between the wickets, a football team that has long spat the dummy lets their defending do all the talking.Mahlambi and James Keene ran at the re-jigged defence at will and Mabokgwane had to be at his best to prevent a first half embarrassment.Mabokgwane kept out two consecutive shots from Mahlambi and Keene in the eighth minute as Wits sent out an early statement.Having embarrassed Ajax Cape Town last week Wednesday, they were in the mood to do the same to Pirates.What was puzzling was Pirates' offensive excellence that should have seen them have at least two goals.Luvuyo Memela and Thembinkosi Lorch tested Darren Keet three times between the 20th and the 24th minutes but there were shades of selfishness in their shots when there were better positioned team mates to pass to.Pirates were also unfortunate not be awarded 36th minute penalty when Nazeer Allie clearly brought down Pirates captain Oupa Manyisa in the box.The lack of protest from Manyisa was telling. The most militant of Pirates' small midfielders seemingly had no fight in him and wondered aimlessly through the game.While Pirates finally found some fight and a goal through Jele after the defender capitalised on a rebound from a Dove Wome shot just past the hour mark, there was the ignominy of Mabokgwane's 76th minute red card after he handled the ball outside of the box. It was the flag of surrender. - TMG Digital
