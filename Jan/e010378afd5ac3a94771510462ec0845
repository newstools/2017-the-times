The union said it had initially placed a demand for a 14% salary increment across the board from November 2016 plus the implementation of the Labour Relations Amendments (LRA) on temporary workers.However this was declined by the university management which was offering 6%. After the deadlock the matter was referred to CCMA for facilitation which sat today. "During the CCMA facilitation the University Management reduced their initial offer from 6% to 4.5%. The union s view is that this reduction confirms the high level of arrogance and our long held suspicion that the employer has not been negotiating in good faith Nehawu said in a statement. It said the reduced offer had angered members and workers in general to a point of agitating them to accelerate and intensify the picketing lines which started yesterday as a building up towards a full-blown strike as a form of highlighting their dissatisfaction against this ridiculous offer by the management . Our members are disgusted by the fact that just recently Unisa wasted more than R100 million on an IT system to be used for purposes to register students for the 2017 academic year. Unfortunately this system is unusable and not of benefit to the institution and is regarded as a wasteful expenditure. In our view this R100 million and in addition to R55 million wasted on a library software which is not user-friendly and also confuses students could have been channelled towards salaries of workers as part of decent wages. What irritates our members more is the fact that the Vice Chancellor earned more than R5 million last year excluding bonuses while workers earn peanuts. The University is also refusing to pay performance bonuses that are due to workers and withdrew pay progression Nehawu charged. The union said it has been permitted to strike from Thursday until the matter is resolved. It added that further details about the strike action would be communicated timeously.
