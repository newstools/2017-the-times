Hichilema, who has refused to recognise Lungu as president, was accused of deliberately endangering his life in the high-speed incident at the weekend."We have charged Hichilema and five others with treason," Zambian police chief Kakoma Kanganja said in Lusaka."The opposition leader disobeyed police orders to give way to the presidential motorcade in an attempt to put the life of the republican president in danger."The accused, who include Hichilema's aides, have been charged with disobeying lawful orders and using insulting language.Treason is a non-bailable offence in Zambia, with a minimum jail term of 15 years and a maximum sentence of death.The state-owned Zambia Daily Mail said Hichilema's motorcade ignored police attempts to clear the road between Limulunga and Mongu, 500km west of Lusaka."The behaviour of Mr Hichilema and his cohorts was not only a senseless act of disrespect to the presidency but also endangered the life of the head of state and many other people," it said.More than 100 armed police officers surrounded Hichilema's house outside Lusaka on Tuesday and teargas was fired before a raid when he was taken into custody.Hichilema's United Party for National Development said on Tuesday he had done nothing wrong and criticised the raid as "barbaric" after his wife and children were trapped and choked by gas.Hichilema has launched several legal attempts to challenge the August election result, which he lost narrowly.He said the vote was rigged and accused Lungu of an unprecedented bout of political repression in Zambia, which has been known for its relative stability.The election campaign was marked by clashes between supporters of Lungu's Patriotic Front party and the UPND.
