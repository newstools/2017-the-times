Speaking at the DA s Eastern Cape provincial congress in East London on Saturday Maimane noted that human settlements minister Lindiwe Sisulu had stated this week that the ANC had reached rock bottom. Let me say this to the ANC today: You re falling but you aren t at rock bottom yet Maimane said. You ll know you ve hit rock bottom in December when you elect another Zuma who will change nothing. And you ll know you ve hit rock bottom when the voters kick you out of government in 2019 he added.
