Our belief is that it can never be workers from our province who have disrupted the rally. The briefing we have is that the majority of them were bused in from Kimberley to deliberately disrupt the rally he continued.Blade Nzimande says this is for him, the lowest point in his history with the alliance. @TimesLIVE #MayDay2017 pic.twitter.com/dwCxbkRw1l Kyle Cowan (@CowansView) May 1, 2017 Blade Nzimande says this is for him, the lowest point in his history with the alliance. @TimesLIVE #MayDay2017 pic.twitter.com/dwCxbkRw1l The belief of the leadership of Cosatu is that the workers in the Free State would be luke warm to carry this anarchy programme he said.He said he did not know who would have bused them in.TMG Digital/TimesLIVE
