The case started with the state withdrawing charges against Mosiuoa Motani and Khulekani Sibanda but it later brought new charges against Motani.The two had been granted bail of R50 000 each when they appeared with five other accused on March 14.The defence team for the two had questioned whether their appearance before court last week was lawful as they had not been brought to court within 48 hours of their arrest.That issue was supposed to be argued on Friday but the state conceded that the two might have been brought to court outside the prescribed 48 hours and withdrew the case against them.However the state served summons against Motani and he waived the 15-day period before appearing in court and decided to appear in court on Friday.The state said he faces charges of armed robbery and aggravated robbery.Motani was released on warning and will appear again in court next Friday for further investigations and the arrangement of a trial date.This means Sibanda is no longer facing any charges for the airport heist as he had not been served with summons.Both men will get their bail money back because Sibanda is not facing any charges and Motani has been released on warning.Five other men arrested in connection with the heist will apply for bail in the same court next Thursday. - TMG Digital
