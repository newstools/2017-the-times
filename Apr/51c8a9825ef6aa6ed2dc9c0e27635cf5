"All of these developments can be traced back to state capture centred mainly around the president and one family aimed at the illegitimate acquisition of South Africa s natural and financial assets."BLSA does not accept this. South Africans should not stand by and allow this to become the 'new normal'."...We have no desire intention or mandate to involve ourselves in party politics."However we regard the present situation as the political and economic low point of our young democracy. We know that without decisive action by leaders in every sphere of South African life our future is bleak."As corporate leaders BLSA makes an urgent appeal to all our elected representatives in parliament and the ruling party and alliance partners in particular to exercise their conscience in taking whatever immediate steps are needed to reverse corruption and state capture and to restore confidence in our country s leadership our economy and the future of South Africa."Business Leadership South Africa (BLSA) is an independent association whose members represent South African big business leadership and major multinational investors.
