We can't used them for patrols when the traffickers are increasingly armed," Abdullah Tomia, a senior naval officer in charge of cooperation with Italy, told a news conference in Tripoli."We've asked Italy to arm the patrol boats," he said, while noting that Libya was still under a UN arms embargo in force since its 2011 revolution that toppled dictator Moamer Kadhafi."Before the revolution, we were dealing with unarmed traffickers. But no we are up against fierce, armed gangs," Tomia said. 1 000% increase in terrorism activity in Africa since 2006Libyan authorities have complained about lacking the means to deal with the floods of migrants who try crossing the Mediterranean in makeshift boats.Last year, a record 181,000 migrants reached Italy, 90 percent of them from Libya.
