With dam levels in Cape Town at 39 2% there is a desperate need to cut water usage wherever possible.Part owner of Around About Cars Geoff Higgo said the business main source of water consumption is by far the washing of vehicles. I d say it 80-90% of our water usage is washing cars said Higgo.His company has a special exemption from the city to wash cars.Clients can either get a R30 discount or donate R30 to Work for Love an NGO situated in Masiphumelele between Fish Hoek and Kommetjie.Work for Love runs a skills development job creation program and offers child care facilities to low income families. Cape Town is in dire circumstances and we are acutely aware of every method to try and conserve water said Higgo.He was inspired to do something about Cape Town s rapidly depleting water resources when he was visited by overseas tourists a couple of days ago. They were completely unaware of the drought despite having been in the Cape for a few days already. One of the first things people do when they visit Cape Town is pick up a vehicle and it s a good way to educate them. He emphasizes however that while the business is benefiting financially the main driving force is to conserve water and said: We will keep it going as long as we need to .On Monday the City of Cape Town once again issued an urgent message about saving water."With the last 10% of a dam's water being unusable City supply dam levels could be seen as effectively around 29% '' according to a statement by the city.Formal residential properties use 65% of the city's water supply. In addition ''particularly high-use areas'' were named. These places include:- Athlone- Newlands- Manenberg- Constantia- Lansdowne- Somerset West and- Kraaifontein."We thank those residents who are working very hard to save water. As for the 20 000 highest water users we will be targeting these households as they need to drastically reduce consumption ' the city said.'- TMG Digital/TimesLIVE
