It all started after a user shared a picture of a romantic breakfast in bed that he apparently served his lady. "Fellas this is how you wake her up on a Sunday morning. Blessed day y'all!," he captioned the picture. Euphonik who is a property mogul noticed the lack of space around the bed, and gave the guy a friendly tip. "Just buy a bigger house so she doesn't have to sleep against the wall or fall on ur ornaments if she rolls over otherwise well done chap," Euphonik tweeted. But things didn't end there! The post was instantly filled with dozens of comments as followers zoned in on Euphonik. You bought a big house and Bonang still left you, but that's none of my business https://t.co/ogQDohbVAYSo what must happen if that's all the dude can manage at this point in time ? hay maan, uyaphapha nje pic.twitter.com/rufd0HnuLy pic.twitter.com/WOjMD1IwFQ pic.twitter.com/wr4s2BDj91Wow Euphonza pic.twitter.com/n7XQ0JNp98Umuncu ke ngoku Euphonik, entlek ungenaphi wena la? pic.twitter.com/LvFAZHtaoH
