Her uncle, Dries Cornelius, said her parents were "devastated" after their 21-year-old daughter's body was found on Saturday outside Stellenbosch. She had also been raped.The blue Golf for which she was allegedly killed had been given to her by her 91-year-old grandmother when she was too old to drive.Cornelius said Hannah's 18-year-old brother could not comprehend what had happened to his sister because he has severe autism."I assume he will never know. You can tell him what happened but he will never stop asking when she's coming back," said Cornelius.A service will be held for the second-year BA student at the Fish Hoek NG Church at 11am on Friday.Besides being an "exceptional pianist" Hannah also excelled academically at high school. Reddam House principal David Clark said she matriculated with six distinctions and an average of over 85%."She made the world a better place. She was one of those outstanding kids. It's such a tragedy what happened," said Clark.Hannah and a male friend were hijacked on Bird Street in Stellenbosch. Her friend - who was stabbed - escaped but she was taken away by the attackers.Geraldo Parsens and Vernon Junald Witbooi were arrested at the weekend and appeared in the Stellenbosch Magistrate's Court yesterday charged with murder, attempted murder, rape and hijacking.Cornelius said the family wanted to know why she had to die."Why? What is the reason behind killing her if you already have the car? If they took the friend and seemingly also tried to kill him . it seems they just wanted to kill."
