This was the finding of Julian Mthombeni, a biomedical technology lecturer at the University of Johannesburg, in her dissertation for her master's degree in public health.In her research she found that there had been a decline by 38% in the number of autopsies between 2009 and 2012, particularly those of miners who had retired. Their families were often unaware of provisions in law that entitle them to compensation if their relative died of an occupation-related disease."Compensation is a fundamental social right that should guarantee a life of dignity for the diseased or injured worker, and his family," Mthombeni said. "The research should inform interventions for turning the trend around."We want to make current miners, former miners, their families and communities aware of the right of miners and former miners to have their lungs and hearts examined after they die ... to determine the presence of compensable lung diseases which might be a result of working on the mines."The Occupational Disease in Mines and Works Act gives anyone exposed to risk while working on the mines the right to have his lungs and heart examined after death, regardless of the cause of death.
