Mantashe s comment comes after Trump slapped a ban on travellers from seven Muslim countries entering the United States I don t think we should be excited about what Trump does. He is the president of the United States. We don t ban Muslim countries. Everybody has a right to religion Mantashe said at a media briefing on Monday.He said South Africa should only focus on the implications of Trump s decisions. If it affects us we ll develop new trading partners. An executive order signed by Trump suspended the arrival of all refugees for a minimum of 120 days Syrian refugees indefinitely and bars citizens from Iran Iraq Libya Somalia Sudan Syria and Yemen for 90 days.
