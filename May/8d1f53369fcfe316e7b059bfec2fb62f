The moment was captured on video by Andrew Cohen in the Kruger National Park.Cohen told LatestSightings.com that they saw a buffalo cow walking out from behind the bush towards the waterhole during a late afternoon drive. In tow was her brand new little calf following diligently behind her. "We then noticed the ellie coming from the left-hand side towards the mom and baby buffalo. It seemed as if he wanted to interact with them both, but this baby wasn t having any of it," he said.As soon as the young buffalo caught glimpse of the elephant, he charged towards the surprised elephant that backed off quickly.
