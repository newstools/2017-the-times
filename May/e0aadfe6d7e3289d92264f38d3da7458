"No one provoked him -- he was cool up until a few minutes before he started hitting the guy," Hour told CNN. "He started verbally abusing and intimidating people. Nothing triggered him, it just happened."He yells, "You think I'm crazy? What about the government!" Then exits the plane. 1.5 hours later and we finally take off. jfcHour said at one point the man in the red shirt walked away only to come back and starting hitting the other passenger again, which is when Hour decided to get involved.The video ended when I stepped in &amp; confronted the man in the red shirt. I told him to leave and squared up with him, he backed down n left. As of now and after speaking with the other passengers the motive for why he did this is still UNKNOWN. None of us have any idea why at all.Hour commended airline staff and passengers for handling the situation 'with grace and respect' saying they did the best they could to diffuse the situation.
