Hendricks hit 13 fours in his 101 which came off 89 balls to help the Lions who were put in to bat reach 329/7.The total marks the fourth time in the competition this summer that teams have posted more than 300.All four of those big scores have been made in the past three days.The Titans piled up 324/7 at Centurion on Friday against the Dolphins who replied with a winning 325/5.On Saturday in Bloemfontein the Knights made 308 for six before dismissing the Cobras for 100 fewer runs.The tone on Sunday was set in an opening stand of 178 between Stephen Cook and Hendricks which lasted into the 27th over - when Jon-Jon Smuts had Hendricks caught at midwicket.Four overs later Cook s innings was ended at 81 when he was bowled by Ayabulela Gqamane.None of the rest of the Lions batsmen were as successful in an innings in which no other partnership reached 45 and no other batsman passed 30.Indeed the Warriors pulled it back well - particularly Gqamane Smuts and Simon Harmer who all went for fewer than a run-a-ball and took three wickets between them.- TMG Digital/TMG Sport
