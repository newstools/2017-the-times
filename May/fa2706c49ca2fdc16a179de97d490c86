At 35 and with trophies won at SuperSport United Orlando Pirates and Mamelodi Sundowns and 22 caps for Bafana Bafana canny striker Mashego can provide an intelligent experienced head for Chippa in their first-ever Nedbank semifinal.Mashego made a comeback from a potentially season-ending three-month injury having torn the quads in both legs starting relegation-threatened Chippa s crucial 3-0 league victory against SuperSport United at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Wednesday night.The player popularly nicknamed Mahoota made way in the 65th minute for big striker Rhulani Manzini who then promptly notched a hat-trick.Mashego signed from Sundowns in November earned the praise of Chippa coach Dan Malesela for his toughness recovering in time for the Chili Boys end to the season. Katlego is a professional. He went home after the injury did not just sit but worked hard to come back to the team Malesela said. He has not recovered fully but he told me he would rather take a risk than watch on the sidelines while the team is going down. He displayed an incredible attitude and I shared what he told me with the rest of the players. His presence can only be positive for us going forward. Chippa meet SuperSport at the rustic Sisa Dukashe Stadium in Mndantsane outside East London (kickoff: 3pm).The Eastern Cape team s mid-week win in the league against SuperSport took them to 27 points and fourth-last place in the PSL a point above second-last Highlands Park keeping Chippa s survival prospects in their own hands.It coincided with Malesela s return after an unsuccessful caretaking spell by assistant Mbuyiseli Sambu from having been put on leave in expectation of being fired.- TMG Digital/TMG Sport
