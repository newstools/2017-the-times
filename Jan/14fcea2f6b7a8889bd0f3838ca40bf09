Liquor Board allows bars to stay open longer for ANC bashHe said he was in favour of not drinking on Sundays to encourage a healthy lifestyle.Earlier on Wedesday Gauteng economic development MEC Lebogang Maile took personal responsibility for the drama caused by the announcement.Just minutes after his department reversed that decision Maile told eNCA that ANC was not to be blamed for the move. I will take responsibility because the liquor board reports to me. I am the political head of the liquor board. I am the deployee of the ANC in that department. You can t blame the ANC. If you are looking for someone to blame blame me. It is fine. Don t blame the ANC Maile said.On Tuesday the GLB announced that it would offer a day passes for liquor traders wanting to trade beyond their prescribed hours from January 6 to 8. The board said this was done as it viewed the ANC celebration to be held in Orlando Stadium as an economic opportunity for the province.However there was a public outcry and amongst the most vocal critics was the ANC Women s League which said on Tuesday night that the idea tarnishes the good name of our glorious movement .The GLB backtracked on Wednesday morning and withdrew the day pass plan. - TMG Digital/The Times
