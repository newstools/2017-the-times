Ramaphosa told MPs yesterday that only President Jacob Zuma was in a position to evaluate the performance of ministers and make a determination on whether they remained in their jobs.The deputy president was responding to a range of questions in the National Assembly yesterday, including questions about the social grants crisis facing Dlamini and the Department of Social Development. He pleaded with MPs to allow Dlamini and the SA Social Security Agency space to manage the crisis to ensure that 17million grants beneficiaries get paid at the end of the month.Ramaphosa said the entire social grants debacle was being dealt with by the Constitutional Court."Members of the executive are evaluated by the president who appoints them."The president evaluates the deputy president and members of the executive on an ongoing basis."Ramaphosa was responding to a question from DA leader Mmusi Maimane, who initially wanted to know what Ramaphosa, in his capacity as leader of government affairs in parliament, had done since his appointment in May 2014 to ensure that Dlamini appeared before committees of the national legislature when required.Dlamini was under fire last week for snubbing a meeting of the standing committee on public accounts to discuss the social grants fiasco, which she attended only on Tuesday.Ramaphosa said in terms of the constitution, members of the cabinet are accountable collectively and individually to parliament."The National Assembly and parliament have much more overriding powers than the leader of government business because here we're talking about what the constitution sets out. The constitution gives us as parliament the power to make members of executive accountable to us as a collective," said Ramaphosa.He said the executive remained committed to account "regularly and effectively" to parliament.
