SDM spokesman Willy Mosoma confirmed on Thursday that a female employee had reported a case of sexual harassment against a senior official and that the matter was under investigation. I can confirm that a senior official in the municipality is being investigated on allegations of sexual harassment. The executive mayor instructed the municipal manager to institute investigations as soon as the victim lodged a grievance this week Mosoma said.He said SDM had developed a sexual harassment policy in 2013 which would guide the kind of action to be taken against the official should he be found guilty. But the investigations are being handled in such a manner that ensures that the identities of persons involved are kept confidential he added.According to Mosoma they viewed the allegations in a serious light but would not put the official on suspension until the internal investigation was completed the findings of which would guide the course of action to be taken. The South African Municipal Workers' Union (Samwu) has called on the municipality to suspend the official while conducting the investigation. As a union we also urge the municipality to ensure that its sexual harassment policy becomes an effective tool to mitigate against behaviours of sex pests. We also want to applaud the victim for speaking out against this malpractice said Samwu deputy provincial secretary Ronald Mani.Attempts to get comment from the alleged victim drew a blank as her phone was switched off.The accused official said it was not true that he had harassed the woman but refused to divulge further details on the basis that the matter was in the hands of the courts.Police spokesman Captain Mamphaswa Seabi said the man would appear in court on May 26 on a charge of violating a protection order the victim had obtained against him.TMG Digital/SowetanLIVE
