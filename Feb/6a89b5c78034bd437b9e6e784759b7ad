Luke told TshisaLIVE that if it wasn't for Richard he wouldn't be in the competition. "Richard has been the absolute best! If it wasn't for him I wouldn't have done The Voice South Africa. He called me on the morning of the auditions and basically said that I don't have a choice," Luke said. The singer added that he is incredibly happy that Richard convinced him and that his friend's advice to him was to be natural. "His (Richard) advice to me was to just be myself," he added. Luke said his experience on the competition has been nothing short of magical. "The Voice South Africa has been something magical. It's taught me so much about the music industry and it's helped me back myself in knowing that I have what it takes to make a successful music career for myself." Luke knows that he's got some tough competition in this year's show but is gunning for that top spot. "I want to be able to support my loved ones and make sure that I can support them in every way possible. And to do that I need to work my way to the top," he said. And away from the camera's Luke has someone like Richard in his corner giving him all those tips no doubt. Watch Luke and Richard's cover of Justin Bieber's Love Yourself ...it's cute!
