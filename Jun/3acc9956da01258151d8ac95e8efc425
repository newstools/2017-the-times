Rohr has been with Nigeria since August last year and says this will be his toughest test yet."They are the strongest opponent I will face so far as [Super] Eagles coach because they have not lost a match over a long time," German Rohr told reporters."I am also aware that they stopped Nigeria from getting to the Afcon in 2015. The game will be difficult. It will be a big challenge to beat the South Africans."It will be difficult with the young players that we have. Our captain, [John] Obi Mikel and our first choice goalkeeper [Carl Ikeme] are out of the match," he added.But he still has plenty of talent from the top leagues in Europe.These are five players who could prove to be match-winners:Kelechi Iheanacho of Manchester City is arguably the best "finisher" in the Nigerian team. He has scored six goals in nine international matches, with his last coming in the 3-0 win over Togo at the weekend.Alex Iwobi of Arsenal can play on either wing and is coming off a good season for the Gunners, netting four goals.He scored for Nigeria in their 2-1 World Cup qualifier victory over Zambia last year, his only international goal to date.Ahmed Musa of Leicester City is the most experienced of Nigeria's forwards. He has hurt Bafana in the past, denying them a rare win when he equalised late in a 1-1 draw in March 2015.Wilfred Ndidi of Leicester City showed his stamina by playing in 59 games for club and country, including both the Uefa Europa League (with Genk) and the European Champions League (with Leicester).Although not known for his goal-scoring, he netted six times.Ogenyi Onazi of Trabzonspor (Turkey) has met South Africa on four previous occasions and is yet to taste defeat.
