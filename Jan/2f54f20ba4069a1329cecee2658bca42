The campaign was started by US-born British venture capitalist Bill Browder after the death of Browder's Russian lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky.Magnitsky was allegedly interrogated and tortured for months in a Russian prison after he exposed major corruption in Russian empowerment deals.The events, chronicled in Browder's bestselling expos Red Notice, have led to legislation targeting the freedom to travel, bank and/or own property of Russians who commit human rights abuses under Vladimir Putin's regime.Such legislation has already been passed in the US (the Magnitsky Act) and Estonia. The UK and Canada are expected to follow suit soon.Macpherson recently asked Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba parliamentary questions regarding whether any Russians on the international sanctions list had entered South Africa in the past five years. Gigaba said he needed passport numbers to give definitive answers."I believe Minister Gigaba is trying to give me the run-around ... If he is not, he is displaying the complete shambles our border entry system is in if he is unable to ascertain if a named individual has or has not entered the country," said Macpherson.Macpherson said he was considering asking the parliamentary portfolio committee on home affairs to call Gigaba to answer the questions directly."I am also considering drafting a Private Members Bill, like the Magnitsky Act, in the US, to have those individuals banned from South Africa," said Macpherson.Browder said he was pleased by Macpherson's efforts."These people will not be brought to justice in Russia because the Putin regime is covering up for them. Legislation like the Magnitsky Act creates fear among Russian human-rights abusers because it turns them into global financial lepers," he said.
