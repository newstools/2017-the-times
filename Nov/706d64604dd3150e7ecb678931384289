Taste is a subjective thing, we know, but when you gather a group of 42 Sunday Times readers together and ask them to blind-taste readymade Christmas mince pies from four retailers, there will be winners and losers. The mince pies were served without any packaging or branding, and the tasters were asked to rate them according to price, appearance, taste and fruitiness and pastry. Auditor Morne Kok oversaw the event, tallied the scores and gave the tasting his stamp of approval.
