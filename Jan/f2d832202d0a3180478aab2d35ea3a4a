Arsene Wenger's side were facing their first defeat - and a major setback to their Premier League title hopes - to Bournemouth after goals from Charlie Daniels, Callum Wilson and Ryan Fraser stunned the Gunners at Dean Court.But Arsenal scored three times in the last 20 minutes as Alexis Sanchez and Lucas Perez netted before Bournemouth captain Simon Francis was sent off, setting the stage for Giroud's headed equaliser in the second minute of stoppage time.The Gunners' gritty 3-3 draw left them fourth, eight points behind leaders Chelsea, who played at Tottenham last night.Wenger had bemoaned the fixture schedule that had Arsenal in action 48 hours after a victory over Crystal Palace.Bournemouth are to appeal against Francis' sending off. Francis was shown a straight red by referee Michael Oliver for his challenge on Welsh midfielder Aaron Ramsey with Bournemouth leading 3-2. If their appeal fails Francis will miss the next three games, the FA Cup third-round tie with Millwall and Premier League matches with strugglers Hull and Watford.At Selhurst Park Paul Clement saw Swansea climb off the bottom of the table just hours after his appointment as manager and in the day's other match Stoke won 2-0 against a Watford side on the slide.
