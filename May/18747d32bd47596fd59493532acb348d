There is little to fault in Parktown's handling of this case which has led to charges being brought against its former water polo coach, who is to appear in court tomorrow.But while Parktown's handling of this may have been by the book, it is not always the case. The system provides plenty of loopholes for sexual predators to remain in education.Research commissioned by the South African Council of Educators examined more than 1000 cases of misconduct allegations against teachers between 2008 and 2012. It found, according to a Mail &amp; Guardian report, that of 26 cases of sexual assault, including rape, only four resulted in dismissals. Of another 23 cases of a sexual or an improper relationship involving teachers, only two resulted in dismissals.In all cases of serious misconduct the most common sanction was a final written warning.In terms of the Employment of Educators Act, the education department has to report to the council all cases in which the sanction is more than a final written warning or a fine. This means that the council, which registers all teachers, would be unaware if an educator had been punished with anything less.To its credit, the council has recognised this shortcoming and is now asking to be alerted when complaints are first received.It is also threatening to publish in the Government Gazette the names of teachers found guilty of sexual assault or of having an improper relationship with pupils.These are all initiatives to be welcomed, as are moves to strengthen the national register of sexual offenders.But, as Parktown is doing, it's also crucial that schools attack a culture of secrecy that allows staff sexual predators to thrive and damage dozens of young lives.
