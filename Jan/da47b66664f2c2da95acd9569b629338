An application granted by the Gauteng Local Division High Court on January 10 gives the City until January 23 to provide emergency assistance by repairing and renovating the homes according to a statement by the Legal Resources Centre (LRC) on Friday.The LRC representing the Wynberg Residents Association brought an urgent application after last year s storms and floods.The shacks made of corrugated iron and gum poles were constructed by the City about 10 years ago as a temporary housing solution after people were evicted from parts of Alexandra as part of the Alexandra Renewal Project. The residents have previously asked the City about a permanent housing solution. It is evident that further anticipated rainstorms could result in the residents becoming homeless the LRC said. The residents are indigent individuals who rely on government social grants and low income work to survive and cannot afford the materials to repair the damage.
