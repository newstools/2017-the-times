The report by law firm Dentons has been hidden in chairman Ben Ngubane s vault at Megawatt Park since July 2015.The inquiry was initiated to establish the causes of the near operational meltdown the utility had suffered in 2008 when it could not adequately supply the economy with electricity.Hiding the report fuelled suspicions of a cover-up of corruption and wrongdoing by the utility s management and board.Only when it became apparent the report could not remain hidden from the public after dozens of Financial Mail interviews with current and former directors and executives of the utility did Eskom s board meet last Thursday formally to endorse its publication.This is quite a departure from Ngubane s aggressive stance over the past two years. On no fewer than four occasions did the nonexecutive chairman fob off Business Day s sister magazine the Financial Mail when asked about the report.- TMG Digital/BusinessLIVE
