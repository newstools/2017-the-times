A 2-0 loss at home to Kaizer Chiefs on Wednesday has left Celtic just two points above the drop zone on 23 points. Below them are Free State Stars on 22 Baroka on 21 and Highlands Park last on 20.Celtic next play both Highlands at home at on Tuesday April 25 and and Baroka away on April 30 in what will be key games in the relegation battle. You can t even call them cup finals Seema said. They are more like league deciders for us. It is still in our hands. I believe that those two games are going to be crucial for us. We just have to make sure we get points and I foresee that we are just going to have to grind out our results. We ll certainly fight for every point and we haven t taken out our calculators just yet he quipped.Seema is likely to have handed over the full reigns to Luc Eymael by the time Celtic play their next league game on April 25 against Highlands.Phunya Sele Sele have a cup quarterfinal on April 22 against Orlando Pirates before that and Celtic hope that the dispute between Eymael and his previous employer Polokwane City will be settled by then allowing him to be able to sit on the bench for the key games.- TMG Digital/TMG Sport
