The family of nine, six of whom share a three-room house, have seen tough times.The father, Jacob Mbete, 54, has already tried to commit suicide.Two of his children have moved in with their boyfriends to escape the poverty in the house. And one daughter, the eldest, is married.Jacob's wife, Mapule, 44, is slumped on a sofa in the lounge.Of the six people they have to feed - including three children and a grandchild - they receive the R340 child support grant for only three, and this is supplemented by Jacob's R1600 renewable disability grant for TB.Jacob says most of the time there is no food, so he cannot always take his medicine. Sometimes he is too weak to get out of bed.He breaks down as he tells of the household's daily struggles. He describes how painful it is to watch an infant cry because there is no baby formula."The baby needs five tins, at a cost of R350 each, per month - R1,750."Of the four children in the home, between the ages of one and 13, two are in school."I was selling vegetables before I got sick but now I am too weak to work," Jacob said. "People say I have Aids and they will not buy from me."Mapule Mbete is reserved, tending to her one-year-old grandchild.She says although the grant amounts are meagre, she dreads imagining what could happen without them.The fate of the grant distribution programme is surrounded by uncertainty. The Department of Social Development is racing against time to conclude a contract with an agency to continue payments.The current contract with Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) expires at the end of this month.The uncertainty is distressing for the Mbete family. Mapule says they are down to their last meal."Besides food, there are funeral insurances to pay, electricity and pocket money for the children at school. We are following the events with the grants but see no proof that we will be paid," she says.Why banks are avoiding Sassa contractsConCourt wants answers from SassaERNEST MABUZAThe Constitutional Court has asked the SA Social Security Agency to provide it with answers relating to its inability to pay grants from April 1.The court discharged its supervisory jurisdiction in the case of the payment of grants when Sassa filed a progress report on November 5 2015, stating that it would assume paying grants on its own from April 2017.However, Sassa and Minister of Social Development Bathabile Dlamini informed the court in a "follow-up report" on March 3 that Sassa would not be able to pay the grants itself and there was no new contractor in place.Now, in directions issued by the court yesterday, it has asked who was the person responsible for determining, on behalf of Sassa, whether the agency would not be able to pay the grants by the end of March.In addition, the court wanted to find out whether Sassa had entered into any agreement with Cash Paymaster Services in relation to the payment of grants from April 1. The court has asked for full details of the agreement.The court said it wanted to find out if Sassa or the minister had any objection to independent monitoring of any agreement Sassa might have entered into with CPS for the payment of grants from April 1.The court requires answers to these questions by no later than 4pm on Monday.
