 We held a meeting with family and the family did not apportion blame to the school s meals said spokesperson Freddy Sepeng. The child in question has a history of seizures said Sepeng.The 15-year-old girl who was in Grade 8 collapsed at the school on Monday while sharing a meal with another learner.She later died. The other learner who was eating from the same plate is perfectly fine said Sepeng.A postmortem would be conducted to rule out any foul play. The department and the police are also investigating said Sepeng.Earlier the Progressive Student Movement released a statement where they claimed several other learners were hospitalized after eating the same food.Sepeng dismissed the allegations saying there were no other cases reported.
