On board one of the yachts the 45-foot Calypso was a couple who were completing a global circumnavigation voyage that began in the harbour town 12 years ago.The couple requested assistance reporting sail and rigging problems and their motor not holding against the 50-knot south-easterly wind on the final stage of their voyage from Mossel Bay to Simon s Town.Sea rescue craft were sent out and the yacht was towed into the harbour and berthed said NSRI Simon s Town station commander Darren Zimmerman.Sea rescuers were then informed that three other yachts that were also sailing from Mossel Bay and arriving in Simonstown and needed assistance into the harbour against the 50-knot winds. Two local yachting crew from False Bay Yacht Club were taken onboard the sea rescue craft Spirit of Surfski II and transported to the first arriving boat the 45-foot yacht Elusion with a Spanish husband and wife onboard and the local yachtsmen went aboard the yacht and assisted them to get into the harbour safely. We then rendezvoused with the third yacht the 30-foot Westwood with a French solo sailor onboard. NSRI crew were put aboard his yacht and assisted to get him safely to a berth in the harbour. We then rendezvoused with the fourth yacht the 50-foot Kantolou with three crew onboard a Brazilian family. NSRI crew were taken aboard the yacht and the yacht was assisted into the harbour where our sea rescue craft Spirit of Surfski II nudged them the last few meters to a safe berthing Zimmerman said.
