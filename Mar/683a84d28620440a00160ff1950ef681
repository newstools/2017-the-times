However, the now retired Gloria Samson didn't want Catherine Joubert to come back as a student, but to assist in the after-school homework centre.There, she joined her childhood friend, Tayala Afrika, who was already volunteering.Now, a year later the two are studying for teaching degrees at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology."I saw Catherine conducting traffic at a road construction site; she tried to hide from me by dropping her head," said Samson."I called her over and told her to quit immediately, then come and assist with our aftercare project.""She and Tayala were among my best students. They excelled and they deserved better.Afrika and Joubert came from poor farming communities and could not afford tertiary education despite university exemptions.But the Homework and Study Club started by Samson and Karen Collett, a researcher in the education faculty at the University of the Western Cape, gave them the chance to realise their dreams.The homework club caters for all the children in the area, aiming to improve academic results."The homework club focused on supporting pupils as their parents are often unable to assist them with their homework," she said.After working with the girls for two months, a Norwegian funder offered to pay for the girls' tuition and university accommodation.The funder offered them bursaries but it was too late to enroll. So Samson took the girls to apply to study this year and both were accepted."They have been there for a month and are enjoying it. Catherine wants to teach foundation phase and Tayala wants to help intermediary phase kids."Afrika said Samson was like a mother to the children she had taught over the years and that the journey was very exciting for the both of them, "because she [Samson] connected us with people who want us to succeed and break the chain of poverty in our families".
