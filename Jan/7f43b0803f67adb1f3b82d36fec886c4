1. Duanne Olivier fast bowler: - He would have been on this list even if he hadn t been called up to South Africa s squad for the third test against Sri Lanka. Able to strike contain and well-acquainted with reverse swing Olivier is the epitome of the young South African quick.2. Aiden Markram opening batsman: - Not many of us are the answer to a trivia question before we re out of our teens but Markram is. Who captained the only South African team to win a cricket World Cup? Markram did exactly that at the 2014 under-19 World Cup. He s all grown up and 22 now and is making a name for himself with Northerns.3. Thando Ntini allrounder: - You read that surname correctly. Yes he is Makhaya Ntini s son. And while he has a mountain to climb if he wants to lace the old man s bowling boots he is already a far better batsman. Ntini just 16 is currently playing for the Warriors Cubs in the Cubs Week in Stellenbosch.4. Jason Smith batsman: - Another member of the under-19 World Cup-winning side Smith scored three centuries and five half-centuries in his first 22 first-class matches. He s also not the worst medium pacer around.5. Sisanda Magala fast bowler: - You have to know what you re doing to get Dale Steyn s attention and that s what Magala did when he earned Steyn s endorsement on social media a few months back as a player to watch. Don t worry. We will. Besides Steyn s backing he has eight five-wicket hauls in 62 first-class games.TMG Digital/TMG Sport
