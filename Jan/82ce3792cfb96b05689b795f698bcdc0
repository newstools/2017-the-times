The Kuga's propensity to go up in flames has many South Africans afraid to use their vehicles, and their resale value has plummetted.At least 43 Kugas made between 2013 and 2014 have caught alight in South Africa since Reshall Jimmy burnt to death in December 2015 while on holiday in Wilderness, Western Cape.That figure includes two more Kugas which caught fire over the weekend.These are some of the best tweets we've seen about the Kuga.@imanrappetti The look when Ford Kuga park next to you #POWERTALK pic.twitter.com/6L2bFqG9cf Sipho Ntuli (@siphon82) January 9, 2017@imanrappetti The look when Ford Kuga park next to you #POWERTALK pic.twitter.com/6L2bFqG9cfWhen yal organising transport &amp; someone says "wait for Thabo wa Ford Kuga" pic.twitter.com/3xaEXYEMXq Khutso (@khutso_95) January 9, 2017When yal organising transport &amp; someone says "wait for Thabo wa Ford Kuga" pic.twitter.com/3xaEXYEMXqWhen you connect your Samsung Note 7 to your Ford Kuga's bluetooth pic.twitter.com/SBimOwboES Ofentse (@Jazz_Nova) January 7, 2017When you connect your Samsung Note 7 to your Ford Kuga's bluetooth pic.twitter.com/SBimOwboESWas driving on Allendale road today singing...then i saw a Ford Kuga! pic.twitter.com/7GVPft6rWC Miss P (@PeruMorkels) January 5, 2017Was driving on Allendale road today singing...then i saw a Ford Kuga! pic.twitter.com/7GVPft6rWCFord Kuga should get an award,its the bomb..literally #CarsAwards Andy (@Arrndy) January 7, 2017Ford Kuga should get an award,its the bomb..literally #CarsAwards#ThingsThatJubJubDoesntKnow We no longer fear veld fires.
