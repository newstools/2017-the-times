Bonang along with David Tlale, DA L.E.S and DJ Dimples were names as brand ambassadors in 2015.Their contracts have all ended. You know, as contracts do."Bonang Matheba was contracted with three other influencers as part of a campaign which ended in August 2016. No contracts were terminated," said Diageo's Marketing Manager for the reserve portfolio Vongani Chinkanda.It was a one year campaign and when the campaign ended, then, well, so did the contract.Well, that's an awkward rumour.It was speculated that because B was in AKA's The World Is Yours music video and was seen in scenes with Cruz vodka, she lost the gig.Except if you watch the video, you'll see the Supa Mega is holding champagne, not voddie. via GIPHY
