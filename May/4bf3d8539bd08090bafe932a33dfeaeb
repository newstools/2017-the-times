IPID issued a statement on Wednesday in which it is claimed that they have information of a planned raid on their offices by the South African Police Service. The Acting National Commissioner Lieutenant General Khomotso Phahlane who described this latest claim as outrageous has consistently refused to comment in the media space since he considers it unethical and counterproductive to conduct investigations and trials through the media. He also respects the position of the Portfolio Committee on Police that the media is not the platform to use to resolve issues of this nature Phahlane s spokesperson Major-General Sally de Beer said on Wednesday evening."The propaganda campaign embarked upon by IPID and this baseless allegation which is completely unsubstantiated by facts must be responded to as it casts the South African Police Service in an undeservedly bad light " Phahlane said in a statement."We can categorically state that there were no plans by the South African Police Service on my instructions or to my knowledge to raid IPID's offices " he added."IPID's statement refers to 'reliable information' relating to a planned raid without giving any clarity as to the source of such 'reliable information' or elaborating on why if such raid had been planned it was not carried out " Phahlane said. He added that the South African Police Service would not engage in a war of words via the media.He urged SAPS members to disregard any attempts to derail their focus and attention from executing their policing duties. Our commitment and dedication must remain on creating a safe and secure environment for all in South Africa at all times.
