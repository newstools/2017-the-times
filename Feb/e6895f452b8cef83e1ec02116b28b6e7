John Smyth 75 head of the Justice Alliance of South Africa was charged with culpable homicide after a 16-year-old was found dead in a holiday camp swimming pool.The former part-time judge was also accused of swimming naked with teenagers showering with them in the nude and encouraging them to talk about masturbation a Channel 4 News documentary reported on Thursday.In the UK a report produced by a church charity but hushed up in 1982 - two years before Smyth left for Zimbabwe - said he administered "horrific" beatings to at least 22 boys at Christian holiday camps held at Winchester College in Hampshire in the 1970s and 1980s often after reading the Bible to them.Hampshire police began investigating the claims on Thursday while Smyth and his wife Anne welcomed visitors to their home in Bergvliet Cape Town but refused to answer questions or respond to messages.The lawyer moved to Zimbabwe in 1984 and founded Zambesi Ministries which held holiday camps for boys from leading schools similar to those run in the UK by the Iwerne Trust a church charity chaired by Smyth.He was arrested in 1997 over the death five years earlier of Guide Nyachuru whose body was found in the camp swimming pool.The case of culpable homicide was dismissed.He also faced crimen injuria charges after five other boys said they had been subjected to savage beatings Channel 4 News reported.Court documents from the time say: The particular allegations are that [Smyth] made the complainants walk naked to the swimming pool at night; that he took showers with them in the nude; that he talked to them about masturbation and told them to be proud of their dicks as Jesus Christ had one; and that he assaulted them on their rear bare buttocks with a table tennis bat. The case collapsed in 1998 after Smyth argued in the Supreme Court that prosecutors had overstated the claims and failed to follow proper procedures.Channel 4 News tracked down boys who attended the camps who insisted the allegations were true.One of them Rocky Leanders said Smyth encouraged boys to talk about masturbation and to just feel free to embrace your body and love your body .He told the broadcaster the lawyer told the boys to swim naked adding: John took part in the activity. He certainly went in the pool. He was at various places throughout still naked watching that we all went out and all came back in. Later the boys claimed they were subjected to beatings with wooden bats.
