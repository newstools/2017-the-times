For months Ford SA was loath to accept responsibility for "critical safety flaws" in its Kuga models, 52 of which caught fire.It was only after pressure by the commission that Ford announced a recall in January of all 1.6l Kugas made between 2012 and 2014. That pressure came to bear only because of a persistent campaign by the Jimmy family after Reshall Jimmy burnt to death when his Kuga caught fire in December 2015.The family should be applauded for their quest for justice.The final straw for the commission - and which pushed it into deciding to investigate Ford officially - appears to be the car manufacturer's "flimsy" internal investigation report into the fires.Ford handed this report to the commission two weeks ago. The apparent lack of substance has clearly infuriated the commission.The commission's planned action is strong, but it does not have a sparkling record of success in Consumer Tribunal prosecutions, which is where Ford will end up.It will be ranged against a global giant with billions of dollars to hire the best legal guns. While Ford has said it will co-operate, the stakes are huge, with a possible fine of billions and even more damage to its brand.But thousands of Ford customers will be looking to the commission for justice in a scandal littered with burnt-out cars and almost valueless vehicles. As our reporting has shown, there is compelling evidence that Ford ignored early warnings of critical problems. Now what's needed is a serious message that consumers' rights are real - and that corporates, no matter how big, can be held to account.
