Not that the defending champion Hurricanes delivered on the Category Four warning some had issued. Their performance was in large parts disjointed but they were still streets ahead in the ball handling and space identification department to separate themselves decisively from the blundering Bulls.The Bulls this week announced that John Mitchell from July will oversee the coaching structures, marking quite a departure from what Loftus had been used to. They will not just have an English speaking coach, but an Uitlander nogal (foreigner to boot).His coaching doctrine is going to require some adjustment here.If this match was supposed to mark a new chapter, yesterday's performance was very much a rough draft.The Bulls committed far too many basic errors and their intensity only sporadically troubled the New Zealanders.It was though, a match that started with some promise for the Bulls. They hit the rucks with fervour and they no longer handled the ball as if it was a pumpkin.They fleetingly looked like they had been rid of a great burden, before debilitating mistakes crept in.Old habits die hard and it was the Bulls' lack of application in defence that helped the Hurricanes grab the initiative on the scoreboard, even if the hosts held the whip hand in possession and territory.The theme was to continue for the rest of the match as the Bulls huffed and puffed inside Hurricanes territory only to be blown away when the tourists got their hands on the ball.Inside the first quarter the Hurricanes scored tries through fullback Jordie Barrett and centre Ngani Laumape and in both instances Tian Schoeman could have been more assertive with his man marking.Schoeman, irony would have it, made his most telling contribution in the collision while in possession in the move that brought down the curtain on All Blacks' flank Ardie Savea's match.As Savea tried to get to his feet it was clear from his wobbly attempts that he needed to be put through the concussion protocol ringer. He disappeared down the tunnel and when he re-emerged it was to take up position on the bench.It made little impact to the Hurricanes. They continued tackle like demons and they continued to turn over Bulls' ball in areas and moments of promise.Although they scored 24 points in the first half their momentum was stunted in the first half by referee Egon Seconds who punished them mercilessly.The defending champions never hit their straps here yesterday but they will be mightily relieved they bagged another bonus point win. In mitigation, they started the match sans their sharpest attacking threat in Beauden Barrett.The All Blacks' flyhalf was earmarked to start but instead played his part as arguably rugby's most gifted water boy. Perhaps mercifully he was kept from the action.ScorersBulls (20):Tries: Duncan Matthews, Nic de JagerConversions: Tian Schoeman, Tony JantjiesPenalties: Schoeman (2)Hurricanes (34):Tries: Jordie Barrett, Ngani Laumape, Wes Goosen, Mark Abbott, Leni ApisaiConversions: Otere Black (2), BarrettPenalty: Black - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
