 Dozens of ready-to-be-sold packs of kat crystal meth and dagga over the approximate value of R16 000 were recovered and the suspects were taken to the Lenasia Police Station to be charged for possession and dealing of illicit drugs he said. Sun added that the City of Johannesburg was clamping down on crime and drugs across the city and that every arrest JMPD officers made meant one less drug dealer on the city s streets. We appreciate the co-operation and help from community members to not only identify drug hot-spots but also the unsavoury characters aiding these criminals he said. However he added that it had been reported that some members of the community were working with the drug dealers and tipped them off about Tuesday s sweeping operation. Had this not been the case we would have seen more arrests and recoveries yesterday. Sun added that the City remained committed to fighting crime and drugs plaguing communities and would do everything in its power to ensure that criminals could not rest in Johannesburg and that residents were kept safe.
