The politician, who is evidently besotted with his wife, Mantwa isn't shy to let the world know. And rightfully so. Malema's most recent tribute to his wifey in celebration of her birthday will definitely give you the feels. Along with a string of pictures from their intimate celebration, Malema penned the sweetest message. "Papa and the boys wish you many more years to come. We now have a family because of your presence and without you we are just lost souls. With you in our lives, we have found the true purpose of life," he wrote.
