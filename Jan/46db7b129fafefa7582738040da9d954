Safa CEO Dennis Mumble yesterday said that although the association would abide by the labour law, there was nothing to suggest that the search for a new coach could not begin.Mumble said Safa had adhered to all requirements during the disciplinary hearing that led to Mashaba's dismissal from his R500 000-a-month job last month.''We have a watertight case that we are 200% sure we cannot lose," Mumble said.'We went through a meticulous process to make sure that all the parties were represented fairly [at the disciplinary hearing]. The process was run by an independent chairperson (an advocate, TT Serero) and we even bent over backwards when we could not get hold of [Mashaba] before the hearing. And when we finally got hold of him on another phone he asked for a postponement and we granted him that. That ticks off the fairness column."Mashaba's lawyer told Sowetan on Tuesday that the case would be taken to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration, and he believed his client had a strong case.Mashaba - who was found guilty on several charges, including gross misconduct and insubordination - wants to be reinstated because he believes he was dismissed unfairly. And, should he not be reinstated, he wants to be paid for the remainder of a contract that was to run until the 2018 World Cup. - TMG Digital
