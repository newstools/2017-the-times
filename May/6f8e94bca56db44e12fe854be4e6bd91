The father and son were among 13 people who were shot in a drive-by shooting in Elsies River in Cape Town on Monday. Four of the men died."I thought my husband would not survive because he was shot five times '' she said after new police minister Fikile Mbalula left her home with a promise to free her neighbourhood from the shackles of gangsterism.Mbalula said the violence in Cape Town could warrant it being declared a state of emergency.The crime prompted a visit from Mbalula who did not hold back his outrage - especially after the community revealed that they have had to surrender to the gangsters."We are going to take extraordinary measures '' he promised. If you say we are dealing with terror and people are living in fear in some corner in the Republic of South Africa then we must react ... we need to look at all our operations. We cannot allow gangsters to take over the lives of people he said. City of Cape Town councillor Franchesca Walker told the minister she is too afraid to do her work. A couple of months ago my office was petrol bombed ... so I am not even stationed within my area. You have got the clinic which is also closed because of the shootings that are happening in front of the clinic she said.She said soon the library which assists youngsters with after school programmes will also close because of the shootings. What is going to happen to our youth to our children? asked an emotional Walker.Imraahn Mukaddam Community Policing Forum deputy chairman described the gangsters as terrorists who were ''running a parallel state in the area''. He said there are no-go zones in Elsies River run by gangsters and that the situation is so bad that youths are openly being trained to be gangsters or drug runners. They are organised as a military outfit ... they have got their own rankings he said.-TMG Digital/TimesLIVE
