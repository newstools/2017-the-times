Enhle and Black Coffee are easily one of the most famous couples in South Africa. But they are also one of the busiest.We caught up with Enhle at the launch of her new show on e.tv, Broken Vows, and found out what a typical day in their home is like:3:30 am : Wake up and read scripts "I wake up around half past 3 and read my scripts. It is the only time that everyone is quiet and no one is calling 'mommy' or 'honey'.6 am : Wake the boys and get ready"At around 6 am I wake the little boys up and get them dressed. My helper will also come in and prepare breakfast while I jump in the shower and get ready for work."A post shared by Black Coffee (@realblackcoffee) on Jun 24, 2016 at 4:43pm PDTA post shared by Black Coffee (@realblackcoffee) on Jun 24, 2016 at 4:43pm PDT6:30 am : On set"My call time is usually 6:30 am.
