This Durban fan's rendition of R. Kelly's track made it all the way to the man himself. How cool? The US singer reposted the video on his Facebook page and said that he was happy the music was universal. "This week's #FanFeatureMonday travels all the way to Durban, South Africa and this fans rendition of #BadMan - I love how universal music is," he said.
