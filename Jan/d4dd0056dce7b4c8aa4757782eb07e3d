Speculation over the future of Jub Jub's music career has been a talking point ever since the troubled rapper was released from prison on parole earlier this month, with fans calling on Mabala Noise to sign the artist.The company has made headlines ever since it launched in July last year with some of the biggest artists in the country including L'vovo, Riky Rick and Nasty C signed to its label.Mabala Noise have been linked with several unsigned artists in the past and an insider at the label told TshisaLIVE that Jub Jub's team had requested a meeting with the label to discuss possibly signing with them."We received a number of phone calls from people telling us that Jub Jub wanted to meet with Mabala Noise but we have yet to finalise arrangements for a meeting. We are hoping to meet with Jub Jub but are now waiting on him," the source said.It's understood that the label would like to sign Jub Jub, but would have to look closely at the rapper's bail conditions to determine whether the decision would be the right one for both parties."It is a complex situation but he is a talented artist that still has a lot to give to the SA music industry," the source said.Correctional services spokesperson Singabakho Nxumalo refused to divulge the details of Jub Jub's parole conditions to TshisaLIVE but said that the department would not stand in the way of any person seeking meaningful employment if the activities were deemed by the department to be wholesome and beneficial to rehabilitation.Mabala Noise spokesperson Mhlo Gumede responded to the claims, saying that Jub Jub had not spoken to the label about possibly signing with them and that any rumour of them signing the rapper are false.Jub Jub's music made headlines earlier this month when a song by the rapper was published on YouTube only hours after his release from prison on parole.In the song, entitled Ke Kopa Tshwarelo (Please Forgive Me), Jub Jub spoke about being misled by the "good life" and called on the nation to forgive him for his mistakes.The song was a massive success with more than 350,000 views in the first five days of its release, making it one of the biggest songs in the country on YouTube.Jub Jub and his friend Themba Tshabalala were convicted of culpable homicide for crashing their cars into a group of school children in 2010. The accident left four dead and two others brain damaged.The pair were placed on parole on January 5 after the Department of Correctional Services said that they had served the required four years of their eight-year sentences.
