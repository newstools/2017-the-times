Orlando Pirates are United s next league opponents at Orlando Stadium on Tuesday night and Baxter was glued to his television screen trying to pick analyse their work under new coach Kjell Jonevret.Baxter made time to watch Chiefs against Pirates despite the fact that United were just about to take on Ajax Cape Town at Lucas Moripe Stadium in Atteridgeville which ended in a goalless draw a few hours later. Yes I managed to watch the whole match they got on top early and opened very well it is probably against the run of play that Kaizer Chiefs scored " Baxter said."Having failed to win they will be looking to do that against us and I am sure that it will be a good game. With a quick turnaround Baxter said he was not bothered too much by the fact that they will be making a short trip to Johannesburg to take on Pirates after two days because that s how the league has fixtured them. I don t worry much about things that I don t have control of I only worry about things that I am in control of."If the PSL say this is the fixture that s the way it is and we just have to get on with it."I can t do anything about it I just have to prepare the players as best as I could. We will do our best to make sure that we try to get something against them (Pirates) away from home he said. I have said on many occasions in the past that all matches are big in the PSL Pirates have just played against Cape Town City and Chiefs where they did not get the required results and I am sure that they will be looking to get back to winning ways against us."I expect a response from my players from this match against Ajax."We have to bring our A game to the party or otherwise their desire to get back on track will overpower us he added.Looking back at the draw against Ajax which robbed them of two valuable home points and an opportunity to go top of the Absa Premiership standings Baxter admitted that he was disappointed with the result and the performance of his players. I am more disappointed with the performance because we did not play with confidence and imagination for the entire match."I knew that there were going to be lots of ups and downs along the way. I just wanted three points to keep the momentum going It is a disappointment that we did not get the required results and that we did not show our quality he said.United could return to the top of the Absa Premiership log on Tuesday night because current table toppers Cape Town City will not be in action and if second-placed Bidvest Wits drop points against tricky Chippa United at Sisa Dukashe Stadium in Mdantsane. - TMG Digital
