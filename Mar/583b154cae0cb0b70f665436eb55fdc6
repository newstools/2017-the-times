A hitch and jockey wheel from the trailer used by the SPCA Special Investigations Unit whose work is to clamp down on dog fighting were also stolen.The theft occurred over the weekend. The trailers were parked behind locked gates on the premises of the NSPCA s training centre in Alberton. It means the organisation is unable to respond to emergencies in the area.The loss follows a National Lotteries Commision (LOTTO) decision to cut animal welfare organistions from its current call for funding applications.National Council of SPCAs spokesperson Christine Kuch said it was just another blow to our organisation . Our Farm Animal Protection Unit has been affected by the loss of their trailer which is an essential piece of equipment especially in their current work assisting donkeys. The fact that a trailer used to transport dogs is inoperative for no matter how short a time also impacts on our ability to react to situations when animals need urgent assistance said Kuch. We remain steadfast. Far from being dispirited we firmly believe that caring people will rally round to offer moral support or dare we hope that someone out there may be able to assist us in terms of replacing the trailer and fixing the second one. Perhaps this is the opportunity to appeal to everyone to send out a loud and clear message that our work is invaluable and that we have support. - TMG Digital/The Times
