North West Regional Court President Seka Monaledi is facing several serious allegations highlighted in a report drawn up by the Magistrate s Commission after a preliminary investigation into her conduct.Parliament s portfolio committee met on Wednesday to discuss a request by the Magistrate s Commission to suspend Monaledi.ANC members of the committee unanimously elected not to support her suspension. Democratic Alliance MP Glynnis Breytenbach said in a statement afterwards that while the ANC told Parliament this week that it was serious about fighting corruption the party had demonstrated that it was "not capable of walking their own talk"."Ms Monaledi will appear before a disciplinary committee shortly to answer these charges. While everyone is entitled to be considered innocent until proven guilty the allegations are serious and the evidence is overwhelming and damning. Pending the hearing it is abundantly clear that this person should not be on the bench " she said.Among the allegations raised in the commission s report are claims that:Monaledi was provisionally suspended by the Minister of Justice on November 30 2016."Despite this the ANC members of the portfolio committee today decided to ignore this suggesting instead that there was an ulterior motive to suspend only black magistrates " said Breytenbach. - TMG Digital
