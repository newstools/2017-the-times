The 22-year-old man faces multiple charges relating to sexual assault and assault. The case was postponed to July 11.The matter first came to light last year when the school discovered CCTV footage showing the man allegedly touching a pupil inappropriately. More than 20 pupils have come forward since.Martin Pelders from an organisation called Matrix Men, which offers support to sexually abused men and boys, attended the court proceedings."We have research dating back to 2004, which shows that, of 136,000 boys who were surveyed in this country, 44% had been raped by the age of 18. "We hear of very few cases actually going to court and often when they do go to court, we find the case has been botched."We have a huge issue with the number of boys in this country who have been assaulted."Pelders said cases of boys being sexually assaulted were often swept under the rug."If we look at this case, it was only by accident that it was brought to our attention."But I am grateful because it would otherwise have slipped under the radar."We know that perpetrators are serial perpetrators - that they will almost certainly [do it again]."Prosecutor Colleen Ryan requested a postponement in the case so that investigations into the incident could be completed. She then said that the matter would in all likelihood be transferred to the High Court.Police searched the man's residence last week in the presence of his uncle, but the defence told the court the search was not carried out in accordance with the search and seizure warrant's stipulations.These require that any search be carried out in the presence of the man and his legal representative.Before proceedings began the man, who is out on bail of R3000, stood outside the court smoking.He was with two women, who shielded him from photographers.After court proceedings had been wrapped up, the women steered him away from a group of journalists to a car waiting outside the court grounds.The man, arrested on November 16 last year, is a past pupil of the school.
