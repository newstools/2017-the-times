Democratic Alliance MP David Maynier said on Tuesday that R13.9 million had been spent on sponsorships of various institutions between 2014 and 2017.This was revealed in answers to a series of parliamentary questions submitted to national government departments. The total sponsorship so far is as follows: Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut (R74,563); South African Chamber of Commerce and Industry (R3,725,624) Black Management Forum (R1,151,393) Black Business Council (R8 050 000) Business Unity South Africa (R22,800) and the Progressive Business Forum (R840,000) Maynier said in a statement on Tuesday. And the biggest sponsors so far are as follows: Department of Trade and Industry (R7,000,000) Transnet (R5,059,002) Eskom (R1,501,763) and Denel (R303,615). It boggles the mind that cash strapped state-owned enterprises would be allowed to use public funds to sponsor private institutions especially when some of these institutions blatantly pursue a political agenda and bite the hand that feeds them he said.The DA plans to ask Auditor-General Kimi Makwetu to investigate the payments when we have all the facts he added.
