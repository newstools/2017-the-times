In a brief morning respite from the weather, Peterson made it into the clubhouse with a bogey-free nine-under-par 62 on the west course at Royal Johannesburg and Kensington Golf Club before play was suspended as more rain fell in the afternoon.The round was due to resume at 6.45am today, with Peterson two clear of England's Aaron Rai and Paul Waring, who both played on the east course.Peterson is naturally right-handed but plays golf left-handed, something he developed while playing with his twin brother as kids."We used to play on a golf course in Oregon, where my grandparents lived, and it just happened that I played left-handed and stayed that way. My parents tried to change it, but it just stuck. My brother doesn't play any more. He's not really that sporty," said Peterson, who is hunting his second European Tour title after beating European Ryder Cup player Thomas Pieters to win last year's Czech Masters.Jbe Kruger is the leading South African on six under and preferred the tough conditions.
