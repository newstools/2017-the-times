Parties that will be taking part in the march include the Democratic Alliance led by the party s leader Mmusi Maimane the Economic Freedom Fighters the UDM and Congress of the People (COPE). Jacob Zuma and the ANC have normalised the abuse of the people s money and institutions for self-benefit while neglecting their duty to create jobs and build a better South Africa. There is no better case study than the province of Limpopo - corrupted to the point of near bankruptcy and economically stagnant said DA spokesperson Mabine Seabe.
