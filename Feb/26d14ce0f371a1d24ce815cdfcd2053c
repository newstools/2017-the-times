The grandson of former president Nelson Mandela on Monday posted a picture of two positive home pregnancy tests showing two bright pink lines.The image was captioned ALHAMDULILLAH which is a saying used by Muslims to express praise to God.A photo posted by Nkosi Zwelivelile (@nkosizwelivelile) on Feb 5, 2017 at 7:58pm PST Messages of congratulations soon started to flood Mandela s timeline.One Instagram user however said it wasn t the most appropriate way to break the news. This is NOT how you break our news though Kanti you are how??? A cute baby bootie or a baby dummy so much cuter not a pee stick joked media personality Bridget Masinga.Mandela responded: Just something to get the day started Queen @bridgetmasinga I've got something coming soon soon. Tuesday will mark a year since Mandela tied the knot with Rabia Clarke in a traditional Muslim Nikah ceremony.A month later Clarke was officially welcomed into the Mandela family and given the traditional name of Nkosikazi Nosekeni Rabia Mandela.This was the Mveso chief s fourth marriage.Before his marriage to Clarke Mandela was embroiled in an unpleasant divorce battle with his first wife Tando Mabunu-Mandela.It was not immediately clear whether the divorce had since been granted.Mandela had wed his second wife Anais Grimaud in a traditional ceremony in 2010.In 2013 however he accused his younger brother Mbuso of impregnating Grimaud. Their marriage was later annulled.In 2014 his marriage to third wife Mbali Makhathini whom he married in 2011 also in a traditional ceremony was also declared null and void in court.
