Fikile Mongwe 36 and her alleged boyfriend Innocent John Pilusa 21 appeared at the Moretele Magistrate s Court on Wednesday for the murder of Selaelo Lekalakala 61 who was found buried in a shallow grave in a bush in Bosplass near Hammanskraal in January.On Wednesday the prosecution filed indictments to prepare for the pre-trial conference which will be heard in the same court later this month when a trial date will be decided.The indictments included a list of witnesses that will be called during the trial as well as the charges laid against the accused. At the conference the defence will contest if there are factors in dispute before proceeding with the trial.It also emerged that the prosecution intended to take the trial to the high court due to the seriousness of the case against the two. They are facing a murder charge and are still in custody.Mongwe who is a sangoma is believed to have instigated her husband's murder in December after the two got married last year. She had been working as Lekalakala's domestic worker since 2014 when his first wife died from an illness.The deceased had been working as an ordinary government employee and was due to retire this year.Last year she allegedly brought Pilusa into Lekalakala's home and apparently introduced him as her nephew and asked her husband if Pulisa could live with them.It is alleged that Mongwe and Pilusa were actually in a romantic relationship and had been secretly sleeping with each other behind the deceased's back.Neighbours had told Sowetan that Lekalakala learnt about the love affair and he and Pulisa had a fight the night before he disappeared around New Year's Day. Pulisa's friend then confessed to police about how the couple had allegedly called him to assist them to remove and bury some rubbish which had been covered in a blanket and placed in an old bath.TMG Digital/SowetanLIVE
