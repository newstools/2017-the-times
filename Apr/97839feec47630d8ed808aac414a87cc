 On Monday 10 April a rogue element produced a gun aimed at Solly Mapaila SACP Second Deputy General Secretary the SACP said in a statement. Mapaila was ascending the stage to deliver the Party s message at the commemoration of the 24th anniversary of the assassination of Chris Hani former SACP General Secretary who was murdered on 10 April 1993. The alleged gunman was caught on video: He reportedly aimed the weapon at Mapaila as he prepared to address the gathering in Ekurhuleni where President Jacob Zuma was also in attendance. The gunman aborted his mission after what seemed to be an alert to him that he was exposed. In addition Mapaila had an umbrella because of a heavy rainstorm. This caused a distraction when he ascended the stage where he shortly announced that he could no longer deliver the SACP message because of the storm and quickly exited the podium the SACP said.Tensions have been heightened in the ANC-SACP alliance after the leftists called on Zuma to step down following the president s controversial cabinet reshuffle last month.The alleged assassination attempt follows killings late last year in Durban which were also linked to conflict between the two alliance partners.The SACP said it would report the latest incident to the police and discuss it with the ANC and other alliance partners.
