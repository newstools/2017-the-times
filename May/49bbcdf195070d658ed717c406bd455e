Fleck is already without first-choice flyhalf Jean-Luc du Plessis (groin injury) and third choice Kurt Coleman (torn ankle ligaments).There has been no indication that a search for a new flyhalf will be mounted.Damian Willemse, who is part of the Stormers squad and has played off the bench this season, has just been named in the Junior Springbok squad to play in the World Championships to be held in Tbilisi, Georgia. Fleck might yet be forced to summon the exciting 19-year-old.Wing Dillyn Leyds has played flyhalf and could do the job on a short-term basis. He stood in when Du Preez left the field late in the first half against the Canes.Another option would be to start Dewaldt Duvenage at No10.The Stormers have a bye this weekend, which will allow Du Plessis more time to recover from his groin strain.There was some good news, though, with the return of Springbok centre Damian de Allende (ankle) and Blitzbok flyer Seabelo Senatla (foot) to training after injury lay-offs.Springbok locks Eben Etzebeth and Pieter-Steph du Toit, who missed the Hurricanes match with calf and knee injuries respectively, were also back in training yesterday.
