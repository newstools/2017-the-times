He was speaking to journalists outside Rietgat Police Station in Sohsanguve near Pretoria following a crime intervention visit. They [Sassa] have reported to me not once but many times Zuma said. Even yesterday I got a brief progress report and so far they are handling the matter. I have said no pensioner must not earn on that day. Zuma said whether the issue was before the courts or not we have to do whatever we can to make sure pensioners get their money . This is what I can promise and I have reports that indicate to me that they are working to sort out the problem. And I am hoping they will. It would be irresponsible not to deal with the issue as we knew that it was coming. So I hope that day they will get paid. - TMG Digital
