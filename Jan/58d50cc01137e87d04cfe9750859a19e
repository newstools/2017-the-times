Doug Place chief marketing officer at Nando's said: "The current poster doing the rounds poking fun at Ford Kugas is definitely not an official Nando s advert. At Nando s we don t poke fun at anyone who has experienced misfortune. In addition this poster does not accurately reflect our visual identity and certainly does not reflect our brand values."Twitter user Floyd Nkuna posted the ad on his timeline hours after car manufacturer Ford announced the recall on Monday of 4556 Ford Kuga 1.6s made between 2012 and 2014.#FordKuga pic.twitter.com/9xfjkD4wrB Floyd Nkuna (@floyd_nkuna) January 16, 2017 #FordKuga pic.twitter.com/9xfjkD4wrB In the ad Nkuna says: If you thought Kuga was on fire you haven t tried our flame-grilled Peri-Peri chicken. He also makes a play on words with the line: Do you Recall the last time you had fire in your mouth. Some social media users lambasted the ad saying it was offensive and too soon . One noted that someone died in one of those fires. TMG Digital/Sunday Times
