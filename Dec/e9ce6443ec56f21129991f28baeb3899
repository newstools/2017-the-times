It's no secret that Somizi Mhlongo is a risk taker of note and lives life on the edge.  Remember that time when Cassper crowd surfed and his flashy gold chain was stolen?  Well, even though there's been many horror stories about crowd surfing, Somgaga didn't care.  "Some say this is dangerous I say its trustworthy I love my ppl," he said.  And, it looked like a great deal of fun!
