During an interview with True Love magazine Dineo revisited the dark time in her life. "I was a very insecure girl; I worried about looks, body, talent and so much more. I remember one tweleb called be obese on the popular Vuzu TV show 10 Over 10. Those words stung me so badly. I couldn't leave the house after that. What would I be leaving for? In fact I hated going to events, I didn't feel stylish enough and felt like the smallest person in the room," Dineo explained. The actress added that the hardest part about moving forward was the slow process of getting over those self-esteem issues. "The harsh reality about having a low self- esteem, however is that you have to figure it out and come out of it all by yourself," she said. Despite being a victim of low self- esteem, Dineo has moved past that and these days isn't shy to let people know she has no space for negativity in her life. Late last year one social media user was shown the door after insinuating that Dineo had plastic surgery on her breasts. I see you re running with your assumptions. Tape does wonders. What you perceive as scars has been there since puberty. Sorry to disappoint your imagination, no work done.
