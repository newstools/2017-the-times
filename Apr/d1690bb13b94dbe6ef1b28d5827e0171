In the letter Bonang states that she feels there is a "slight brand misalignment" between herself and the public broadcaster.She goes on to thank the SABC for the opportunity. A courteous resignation letter, right? Except Bonang makes no mention of the fact that she was unhappy that she was given a co-host. After resigning she went onto Twitter to say that she had only been told an hour before her show that Lerato Kganyago would be joining her as a co-host. She told TshisaLIVE that she felt "bamboozled" and had no inkling that there would be changes.WhatsApp communication between Bonang and the SABC proved otherwise, though. TshisaLIVE on Wednesday revealed the numerous attempts the public broadcaster made to meet with Bonang to inform her of changes to her show.Sources at the SABC have also told TshisaLIVE that Bonang made no mention of being angry about having a co-host and her resignation was "very cordial.""Management is angry. She refused to say anything about Lerato and just said there was "misalignment." Then she denies any knowledge of the meetings. She has burnt her bridges this time," said one insider.B, meanwhile, is ignoring the drama and flying high. A post shared by Bonang Matheba (@bonang_m) on Apr 5, 2017 at 9:54am PDT
