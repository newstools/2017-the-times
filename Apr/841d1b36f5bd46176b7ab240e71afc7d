Businessman Marius Barnardt opened a case of fraud and corruption against Morris at Welkom police station but soon after withdrew it.The EFF chief whip in the council, Thomas Macingwane, has pressed similar charges against Morris.The Welkom police have confirmed that a case of corruption had been opened.Barnardt told The Times a fortnight ago that he had lent Morris R10000 but had been repaid in full.But in an affidavit three weeks ago Barnardt alleged that Morris asked for a R20000 bribe to get him Matjhabeng contracts but he could pay only R10000."Morris arranged to meet me at Matebesi's Pub . Morris asked me for R20000 for his boss and the person that will help me get the work [but] I told him I do not have that kind of money."Morris told me he will let somebody else do the work if I do not give him the money [because] it's his constituency to give work to people as he pleases."When contacted for comment, Barnardt asked: "How much are you prepared to pay for the story? I don't have any comment for any newspaper."My statement states that it [the R10000 that changed hands] was a loan and that's it," he said.Macingwane questioned the about-turn by Barnardt, saying that Barnardt feared being implicated in the investigation ."The white man is taking chances. I think what scared Marius is that the police told him to be aware that at a later stage they will also charge him because he is also a participant in a criminal activity and that's when he became scared that he opened a can of worms that he might not be able to contain," said Macingwane.ANC council speaker Bheki Stofile said the allegations against Morris had been brought to his attention and an investigation was under way.
