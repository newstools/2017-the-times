Police divers were called to the scene after the 15-year-old boy was reported missing while swimming in the strong-flowing river.The river has made it impossible for divers to conduct an underwater search with officers resorting to scouring the banks of the river downstream.Crocodile spotted on the banks contributed to dangerous conditions preventing divers from taking to the water.A police helicopter is expected to be called in on Wednesday to aid in the search for the boy.
