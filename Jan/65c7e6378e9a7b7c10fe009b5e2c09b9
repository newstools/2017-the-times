AKA and Bonang were on a mid-holiday shopping spree this past weekend when the Supa Mega posted a picture of himself with his shopping bags in the swanky Y-3 store in Hong Kong.WE FROM THE NORTH WAY!!! pic.twitter.com/35OczCMfZc AKA (@akaworldwide) January 15, 2017 WE FROM THE NORTH WAY!!! pic.twitter.com/35OczCMfZcBut one of the rapper's followers was not impressed by AKA showing off in the post, and claimed that a "sale" sign nearby showed that he had bought the goods on the cheap.In a tweet that has since been deleted, the user said while everyone else was obsessing over the shopping black bags, all he saw was the sale sign.Bonang did not take the criticism lying down and defended her man with a stinging clapback on Twitter.@_ihavenone that's what you WILL see when you have no money. power. or respect.
