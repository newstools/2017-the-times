How does South Africa invest in the future of its economy? One way to support growth is for tomorrow’s trailblazers to spend time with and learn from South Africa’s most experienced business leaders. That is the aim of the Sunday Times Top 100 Companies’ Leaders on the Move mentorship initiative, presented in association with the JSE. On the day of the next event, Friday November 10, a small, selected group of budding entrepreneurs will once again travel on a luxury coach around Johannesburg, hosted by Dylan Rogers, editor of the Business Traveller magazine. Along the way, they will spend one power-packed hour at a time with carefully chosen business leaders who will share their business philosophy; the highs and low of their business careers; lessons learnt on the way; and how they’ve overcome adversity.
