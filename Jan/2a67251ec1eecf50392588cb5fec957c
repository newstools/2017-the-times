Karlien, who was married to Derick Hougaard at the time, was 19 weeks pregnant with a little girl who they had named Evah.It's been two years since the tragic incident and Karlien remembered her baby girl with a touching post.Karlien described the day she was rushed to hospital, after suffering from complications, as one of the hardest days of her life. Evah was in my uterus for 19 weeks, where I nurtured her, I loved her and I talked to her. She was the first little girl in our family. We were excited but also scared," she wrote.Karlien went on to add that she blamed herself for the miscarriage."I almost regretted expecting a girl because the responsibility felt too big. The day I lost her, I thought about that and I started thinking it was my fault because I was scared to raise her," she added.The singer also detailed the pain she felt after losing her baby. "Sometimes the nights were so dark, I slept with a bed lamp on and slept with her teddy bear."Even though the pain will no doubt remain with Karlien for a lifetime, she hoped sharing her story would motivate other women."Whether you are pregnant for one week or five months, each person's pain is their own. You are allowed to mourn."In memory of her little girl Karlien also got a tattoo on her arm.
