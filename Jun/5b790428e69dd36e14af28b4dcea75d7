Baroka spokesperson Jimmy Ngobeni on Tuesday confirmed that Dlamini has been frozen out but he declined to divulge the reasons behind his suspension. We have suspended Milton Dlamini with immediate effect from the duties of the team until he appears before the club's disciplinary committee said Ngobeni on Tuesday. Dlamini's suspension relates to his behaviour which has not pleased the club's management at all Ngobeni said without elaborating. According to the management Dlamini's behaviour is viewed as being detrimental to the entire team including its supporters."As you can imagine we're in the middle of crucial playoffs and DC can only finalise its finding after we conclude the playoffs. Dlamini refused to comment. My chairman is in Cape Town at the moment and I am not allowed to comment on this issue until I meet with him when he is back (on Wednesday) or on Thursday said Dlamini.Dlamini was roped in on a short-term contract until the end of the season together with Thobejane as co-coaches in March.Dlamini and Thobejane were installed following the suspension and subsequent sacking of the previous technical team led by technical director Mark Harrison head coach Jacob Sakala and his assistant Edward Williams.Harrison Sakala and Williams appeared before the club's disciplinary committee before their contracts were terminated. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
