BBC president Danisa Baloyi said the move comes after BBC representatives were kicked out of a National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac) meeting by Busa delegates.This marks the end of a 23-year partnership between white and black business representatives.Baloyi said: "The BBC will continue participating in Nedlac as an independent voice of black business and we believe this will provide a great opportunity for BBC to advocate the aspirations of our people."We have declared 2017 the year of radical economic transformation and on platforms such as Nedlac we will continue to advocate a less apologetic approach to economic redress."The closed-door approach by Busa is directly contrary to the BBC s open-door policy which has been a key pillar of the 23-year-old relationship."BBC secretary-general George Sebulela said: "Civil society must be wary of these approaches lest they become the next victims of Mabuza s constant exclusion of black people in positions of power " referring to Busa president Jabu Mabuza.Sebulela said: "White business cannot keep the social dialogue alive alone. You need the BBC a different organisation fighting for the aspiration of black people and white business doesn t seem to realise this fact. They are finding it very difficult to work with black people."BUSA says it is the recognised voice at Nedlac for business and that it had formally advised the BBC of the termination of cooperation at Nedlac on May 11 this year.In a statement released on Monday Busa said: The BBC will no longer be represented through Busa at Nedlac. This does not prevent the BBC from seeking their own seat at Nedlac in line with the Nedlac Act and Constitution. Busa added that the decision to terminate the participation of the BCC through Busa in Nedlac was taken unanimously by the Busa board and that the two organisations were not aligned on key issues facing the economy.- TMG Digital/BusinessLIVE
