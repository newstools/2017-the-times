The association welcomed the new regulations published in the government gazette on Wednesday saying the move could save rhino lives.However the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) is sceptical questioning the government s ability to police the legal and illegal trade simultaneously.The regulations aim to manage the selling or trading or acquiring of rhino horn within the borders of South Africa and the export of rhino horn for personal purposes.The draft regulations provide for a person from a foreign state who visits South Africa to export a maximum of two rhino horns and only for personal purposes.The regulations say a foreign visitor must submit an import permit issued by the management authority from his own country or a letter confirming that it would issue the permit.The draft regulations also state that OR Tambo International Airport should be the only point of entry or exit of any rhino horn or rhino horn product such as powder.Interested parties and citizens have a month to comment.The draft regulations follow a judgment in the high court in November 2015 which set aside a February 2009 moratorium barring the trade of rhino horns in South Africa.The ministry was unsuccessful in its appeal to the Supreme Court of Appeal in May last year.The ministry of Environmental Affairs noted last year that the judgment did not relate to the international trade in rhino horn for commercial purposes which was still prohibited in terms of the provisions of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).Private Rhino Owners Association chairman Pelham Jones said the association was opposed to a moratorium on the legal sale of horns. While the moratorium was well intended it has been a dismal failure and has not saved the life of a single rhino. It instead created a black market. Jones said his members bore a huge financial burden to look after the rhinos in their reserves which many owners could no longer afford.Jones said private reserves owned over 6 000 black rhino and about 450 black rhino which constitute 33% of the rhino population in the country.Dr Colman O Criodain WWF wildlife policy manager said reopening of a domestic trade in rhino horn would make it even harder for already overstretched law enforcement agents to tackle trafficking of rhino horn.Dr Jo Shaw Rhino Programme Manager for WWF South Africa said the organisation was seriously concerned about the challenges that law enforcement and permitting officers would face in trying to manage parallel legal and illegal trade.Shaw urged the government to retain the moratorium and focus efforts on disrupting the organised criminal syndicates involved in rhino horn trafficking.
