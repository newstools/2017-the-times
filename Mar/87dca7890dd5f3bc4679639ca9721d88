It was not immediately clear whether he was charged with a crime.St. Paul City Attorney Samuel Clark is reviewing the case for possible misdemeanor charges, according to a Tuesday story from the Pioneer Press, which first reported Kaine's arrest.Clark's office did not immediately respond to request for comment from Reuters.Tim Kaine, who represents the state of Virginia, told the Pioneer Press in a statement that he respected his children's' political positions."We love that our three children have their own views and concerns about current political issues," he said in a statement to the Pioneer Press. "They fully understand the responsibility to express those concerns peacefully." (Reporting by Timothy Mclaughlin; Editing by Andrew Hay)
