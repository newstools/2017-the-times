From luxury lofts and hotels to trendy bars and art galleries, the area is getting a new lease on life and casting a shadow over posh Beverly Hills and Hollywood, which have traditionally drawn visitors to the sprawling city.Dilapidated office buildings that sat empty for decades are now buzzing with activity while Art Deco structures and theatres are being refurbished to their historic splendour."When I was growing up, the downtown area was pretty much a ghost town, really derelict and a place you would always drive past," said Brigham Yen, an estate agent who has chronicled the area's revitalisation on his Downtown LA Rising blog."But over the last 10 years and especially since 2013, there has been a shift and the story here is we are creating a city - a city within a city," said Yen."We are doing this block by block and downtown Los Angeles is becoming a destination," said Carol Schatz, the longtime head of the Central City Association and a Los Angeles native.The defining date for the start of the city's renaissance was 1999, when officials adopted an ordinance that made it easier for developers to convert buildings downtown into housing.Investors initially shied away and the 2008 economic crisis didn't help. But the stars seem to have finally aligned in favour of the city's rebirth. Construction cranes that crowd the downtown skyline attest to the revival, as do the tall buildings that are gradually replacing parking lots."At the time we started this effort, the city had about 18000 people living downtown," Schatz said. "We now have about 69000 people living there." Since 2000, investors have poured $30-billion into the downtown area."I think this is unstoppable," Schatz said. "There is a recognition among the general population that our city finally has a vibrant centre."Chinese investors are involved in some of the biggest projects, including Metropolis, comprising a hotel and three residential towers that will be the largest mixed-use complex on the west coast once it is completed in 2018.Yen said as demand for housing has increased so have prices, which have more than doubled in some areas. "A studio rental in some buildings will cost at least $2300 a month when in 2013 it was probably $1700," he said.Nowhere is the downtown LA rejuvenation more apparent than in the Arts District, where international designers, trendy shops, art galleries, and media and tech companies are snapping up converted warehouses and industrial lots at a dizzying pace.Warner Music Group next year plans to move hundreds of employees from the Burbank suburbs to a former Ford car factory in the neighbourhood.But while the district's transformation has been good for business, it has also put an end to the cheap housing and warehouse space that first attracted artists to the area.Gentrification has also put a spotlight on Skid Row, a 50-block sliver of downtown that is home to one of the largest concentrations of homeless people in the US. Shatz said some investors had been turned away by the infamous neighbourhood, but most recognised efforts being made by city officials to build affordable and temporary housing. "I think it's extraordinarily important that people have a new-found pride in their city," she said.Roya Moharrami, a resident of Culver City, located west of Los Angeles, said she rediscovered the downtown area and now keeps coming back for more."I used to come downtown and there was nothing here," said the 47-year-old jewellery designer. "It's amazing how they have refurbished it."
