On Friday the Cape franchise announced the signing of five new players including openside flank Stefan de Wit and hooker Ramone Samuels from the Lions. The Lions finished as runners-up in last year s tournament and unearthed and developed many young players among them Samuels and De Wit. Joining the pair from Johannesburg are utility back Dan Kriel and fullback SP Marais from the Bulls in addition to looseforward Johan du Toit from the Sharks. Kriel is a twin brother of Springbok centre Jesse while Du Toit is the younger brother of Bok lock and current SA Player of the Year Pieter-Steph du Toit. Director of Rugby Gert Smal said that each new signing would offer something unique to complement the current playing roster. "In Stefan de Wit we have a genuine openside flank who plays towards the ball which should bring some balance to our loose forwards Smal said. "Johan du Toit is a powerful player with a good rugby brain who can cover more than one position in the back row. "Ramone Samuels is a hooker who has shown great potential and I am looking forward to seeing him grow in our set-up and in SP Marais we have an experienced head at the back. Dan Kriel is an exciting player who has great versatility. The Stormers pre-season fixtures have also been confirmed starting with a trip to Harare in Zimbabwe where they will face the Toyota Cheetahs on January 28th. That is followed by a clash with franchise partners South Western Districts in George on February 4 before concluding their preparations for the 2017 Super Rugby season with a match against the Lions at Newlands on February 11.- TMG Sport
