DA leader Mmusi Maimane said he had written to the speaker of the National Assembly Baleka Mbete to have the motion debated in parliament.Maimane s statement says since Zuma s reckless and irrational decision to recall Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and hid deputy Mcebisi Jonas from the UK on Monday that gains made by Gordhan and Jonas to restore credibility in our economy following the axing of Nhlanhla Nene last year have all but been eviscerated . Zuma has threatened our economy by dangling the possibility of firing Gordhan and Jonas before the country and before the world by using a bizarre and seemingly last minute 'security report' to justify such removals. This is nothing more than an attempt at total state capture and cannot be accepted Maimane said.He was referring to confirmation by the SACP of media reports that Zuma had attempted to use an intelligence report whose author remains unknown to motivate the removal of the finance ministers. The President s actions confirm what we already know: Zuma has abandoned the interests of the people the economy and South Africa in favour of a kleptocratic Guptamocracy where the keys to the Treasury and the Government are made available to anyone who puts Zuma first and the people last the statement continued. The Treasury stands as the last line of defence against Zuma and his project of state capture and unfettered looting. Maimane called for all parties to support the motion and asked the SACP to put action to their words .Meanwhile EFF leader Julius Malema was due on Thursday afternoon to file an application with the Contsitutional Court in a bid to have the court rule that Mbete must act against Zuma. We approach the Constitutional Court as a last resort based on the belief that Zuma's conduct around the Nkandla matter both inside and outside of Parliament renders him unfit to hold the high office of President of the Republic of South Africa said a statement from EFF spokesman Mbuyiseni Ndlozi.- TMG Digital
