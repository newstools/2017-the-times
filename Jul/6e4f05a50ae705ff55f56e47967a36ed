The Lebogang Manyama fairytale continued on Monday night after the Cape Town City captain walked away with three accolades at the Premier Soccer League’s (PSL) annual awards gala dinner, including the coveted Footballer of the Season award. Manyama saw off stiff competition from Bidvest Wits captain Thulani Hlatshwayo and Mamelodi Sundowns veteran  Hlompho Kekana to win the night’s main award — the Footballer of the Season gong — in a race that many described as too close to call. The night certainly belonged to Manyama as he also walked away with the Player’s Player of the Season and the Top Goalscorer awards. Manyama was nominated in four categories but his City colleague Aubrey Ngoma stopped him dead in his tracks  when he edged his captain to win the Telkom Knockout Player of the Tournament award. But Manyama was always expected to be crowned as SA football’s best player and the man himself said a few days ago he was confident of walking away with the accolade. ‘‘I have to be confident that I will win the award but at the same time I have to be humble and also respect the two gentlemen (Hlatshwayo  and Kekana)‚” Manyama said at the time. Absa premiership champions Wits also enjoyed a successful night as Gavin Hunt won the coach of the season award while Darren Keet was recognised as the league’s best goalkeeper after helping the club to win a maiden title in its 95-year existence in May. There are winners for Wits as captain Hlatshwayo won the defender of the season gong, Phakamani Mahlambi won the young player of the season and veteran Daine Klate was crowned as the MTN8 Last Man Standing.
