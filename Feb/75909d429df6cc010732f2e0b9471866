We bet you didn't know that Ntsiki has just completed her masters in writing. It's okay, neither did we!But this may be good news for those who want to do what Ntsiki does. No, not throwing the best shade on Twitter but rather how to use "beadwork and writing as a form of healing".The idea seems to be in the concept stage at the moment, but Ntsiki can already see herself giving classes all over South Africa. She feels that she has a lot to give (creatively) and that is it time for her to give back.And just to show you she's on top of her game, Ntsiki shared some insights on beads.
