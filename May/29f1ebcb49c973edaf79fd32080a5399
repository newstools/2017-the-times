South Africa are away in Nigeria in their opening match of the 2019 African Nations Cup qualifiers on the weekend of June 9-11 and a fully fit Jali with his experience and ability would be a major boost.The 27-year-old has had a topsy-turvey season at Oostende which started with an injury and then fitness concerns.He has made just eight league starts the latest on Sunday as he helped Oostende to a 4-3 victory over Gent only the second time he has played a full 90 minutes for the side in the top division.His coach Yves Vanderhaeghe says he has thrown the Bafana star back into the mix because he has seen a change in attitude and physical fitness and admires what he offers the team. It helps that he has lost two kilograms and one thing that is certain is that the quality is definitely there Vanderhaeghe said. In training he has shown that he has regained his motivation and his smile. Vanderhaeghe does admit that it has not been the season he had hoped for from Jali but he believes the closing weeks give him an opportunity to change perceptions.Oostende have three matches remaining this season and are out of contention for the league championship but very much still in the running for the UEFA club competition places.They currently sit fourth in the UEFA Europa League qualification play-off place but if they overhaul Gent three points ahead of them they will advance straight into the competition next season.The first of those three matches is on Saturday at Zulte-Waregem. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
