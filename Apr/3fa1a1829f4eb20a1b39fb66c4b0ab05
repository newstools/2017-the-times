That sequence of events did not appear on the clip.What it shows is the unidentified man standing up and yelling at the flight attendant: "You do that to me and I will knock you flat." The crew member then points his finger angrily and challenges the passenger to hit him. The video shows the man eventually returning to his seat.American Airlines said it was investigating the incident, which took place before a flight from San Francisco to Dallas."We are deeply sorry for the pain we have caused this passenger and her family and to any other customers affected by the incident," the airline said.The woman elected to take another flight and was upgraded to first class, said American Airlines.
