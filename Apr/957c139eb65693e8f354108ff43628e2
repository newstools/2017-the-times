National Union of Metalworkers of SA KwaZulu-Natal secretary Mbuso Ngubane said bus companies affected by the countrywide strike included Translux, Greyhound and City to City."There is no bus that is moving out of Durban Station bus terminal. It is unfortunate we're embarking on a strike on the eve of a busy long weekend," said Ngubane.Calls to Eldo Coaches, Translux and Greyhound at Durban's main bus terminal were not answered.Bus drivers are striking for a 12% pay rise. Numsa, the SA Transport and Allied Workers' Union and other unions have been locked in wage talks with employers since January."The result of negotiations could not yield any positive results because of recalcitrant employers," said Ngubane.He said the demand for a 12% rise was based on the fact that drivers were expected to drive 16 hours without resting, which "puts their lives and the lives of passengers and motorists in danger".He said drivers were required to park their buses during off-peak hours and they were not paid during that time.However, he said Numsa was ready for negotiations in the hope a deal may be struck before the start of the long weekend tomorrow.Frustrated passengers crowded the offices of bus companies yesterday demanding refunds and inquiring about schedules.Metered taxis did a roaring trade driving some of them home.Malawian Alex Wilson spent R670 on a ticket to visit his brother in Cape Town. He was supposed to board an Intercape bus yesterday."I never knew about the bus strike. It was only when I came here at 8.30am I was told there were no buses. I tried to talk to them to give me a refund and they promised me they would," he said.He was not the only frustrated passenger.Clelio Karbe, from the Democratic Republic of Congo, was still hopeful that she would make it to Cape Town to spend Easter with her mother after she was told that a bus was on its way."They (Intercape) said I should wait. There are people who have been here since 8.30am demanding refunds. They refunded those going to Johannesburg and Pretoria. But they told us to wait," she said.
