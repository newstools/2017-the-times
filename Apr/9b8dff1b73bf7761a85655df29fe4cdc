Sello Maake Ka-Ncube boasts an acting career that spans over 40 years.Bu he recently said on Real Talk with Anele that the most "heart-warming" performance he ever gave was one where his daughter didn't have to lip-read."It was the most heart-warming performance because for the first time my daughter did not have to lip-read, because there was an interpreter on stage signing the play for her."Sello explained that although he had done plays in London that signed for a deaf audience, doing it at The Market for House of Truth meant a lot to him. He said that his daughter has made him a better actor because he learned that he could not just "speak to her in passing"."The thing about it is that because of her deafness, she has to see. A slight a twitch could be that you are angry. Deaf people hear with their eyes," he explained.He went on to quote a line from Shakespeare's Sonnet XXIII that says, "To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit," which he said best explained his daughter's lesson to him."Shakespeare [in that poem] talks about how my looks should be the one that tell you how I feel. In order for her [daughter] to believe me, I have to be truthful all the time," he said.
