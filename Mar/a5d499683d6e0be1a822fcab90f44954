Earlier this week Dr Malinga responded to losing the Song of the Year award at the Metro FM Music Awards by claiming that Nasty C was a 'pawn shop' that took things that didn't belong to him.Well it seems that Nasty C might have been watching.The Hell Naw rapper took to Instagram on Wednesday to post a video addressed to a hater seemingly in response to the shade.Nasty C really goes in hard in the video, showing receipts of his hard work and calling his hater a 'f*cking gimmick and a publicity stunt'Nasty C didn't mention Dr Malinga by name but his references to his hater's "green shorts up to his man boobs" and "pretending to kick down planes on stage" had fans guessing that there was only one artist on the rapper's mind.Take a look: A post shared by Nasty_C (@nasty_csa) on Mar 14, 2017 at 7:46pm PDT A post shared by Nasty_C (@nasty_csa) on Mar 14, 2017 at 7:46pm PDT
