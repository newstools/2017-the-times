Authorities detained nine members of a trafficking group that used illegal migration routes to take the girls from Nigeria to Spain. It was headed by three Nigerian women, police said.The victims, all poor, were approached "very young" with promises of a good job in Europe.They were submitted to voodoo rituals threatening terrible consequences to them and their families if they disobeyed the organisation, police said, before undertaking a gruelling trip to Europe via Niger and Libya.Smugglers paid by the group took the girls across the Mediterranean to Italy in rickety boats with scores of other migrants.In Italy members of the organisation took them out of migrant detention centres where they had been housed. They travelled to Spain by plane, using IDs belonging to other Nigerian women living legally in the country.In Spain they were instructed to ask for asylum so as to avoid potential deportation.They were told they owed the organisation between 40000 and 45000 and were forced into prostitution in Bilbao and Benidorm."They had to go and prostitute themselves every day and couldn't come back until the early hours of the morning," police said.One of the victims who fell pregnant aborted straight away and continued to prostitute herself.Police said the organisation had been dismantled and seven victims were rescued.The International Organisation for Migration estimates that of the thousands of Nigerian women arriving in Italy , 80% are victims of trafficking.
