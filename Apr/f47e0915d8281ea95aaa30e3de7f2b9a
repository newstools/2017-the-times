According to Purchase, who posted the video on Youtube, lone bulls like this are known as "Dagga Bulls" or "Dagga Boys". This is because of the thick black clay on their skin - according to Africa Geographic dagga is another word for mud.Purchase added that "Adventure riders can relate to the name as we are also pushed out of the herd and forced to roam alone or in small groups."Ten months ago Latest Sightings posted footage of a buffalo charging a car: Five months ago it was a hippo. Seven months ago a child provided classic commentary on lions. And last year National Geographic provided the facts about how an ostrich can keep up with cyclists. Of course National Geographic are no strangers to being chased by animals, as this footage from Assumption Island shows.
