"We are saying to them at least once, stand up, be counted, join that motion of no confidence because deep down in your heart you know that Zuma is not only destroying South Africa but he is destroying that same ANC," said Vavi.Vavi was speaking at a protest organised by SaveSA, following the president's decision to reshuffle his cabinet, sacking his popular finance minister Pravin Gordhan and Gordhan's deputy, Mcebisi Jonas.The decision was announced just before midnight last Thursday.The reshuffle was apparently based on a dubious "intelligence report" that alleged that the two were, while on an investor road show to the US and UK, to secretly meet backers to discuss support to overthrow the government.The move angered some of the top ANC members who claimed they were not consulted."The list was given to us complete. The list might have been developed somewhere for us (the ANC top six) to legitimise," Gwede Mantashe said.Zweli Mkhize said, "Unlike previous consultations which take place with senior officials of the ANC during such appointments and changes to the composition of the national executive, the briefing by the president left a distinct impression that the ANC is no longer the centre and thus depriving the leadership collective of its responsibility to advise politically on executive matters".Cosatu were not consulted in the decision, according to spokesperson Sizwe Pamla.The SACP said This recklessness has provoked widespread concern and anger within the ANC itself, and across all sectors of our society. We have reached a decisive moment in which, in the considered view of the SACP leadership, Zuma must now resign. Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa said that he was unhappy with the president's decision, but would remain as Zuma's deputy.The ANCYL has come out in support of the reshuffle, while the ANCWL claims the reshuffle is not factional.
