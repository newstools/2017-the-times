With only a few minutes left to vote 1 872 people had voted with 79% saying they would not buy a Ford while 21% said they would.The poll was conducted in the wake of Ford SA s recall of its 2012-2014 Kuga 1.6l EcoBoost after complaints of almost 50 of the vehicles having caught fire. More than 4 500 vehicles are affected by the recall.Ford South Africa chief executive Jeffrey Nemeth told a press conference that the fires were caused by overheating due to poor coolant circulation that led to an oil leak."If the oil leak reaches a hot engine component it could potentially catch fire," he said.The voluntary recall of the 4,500 cars is down from a previous estimate of 6,300, and will only affect Kuga models built between December 2012 and February 2014.Nemeth refused to reveal the cost of the recall to Ford, which will replace affected components on the cooling system, update software and conduct tests on cylinder heads.In October, the company's North American arm recalled 400,000 units of the Ford Escape - the U.S. version of the Kuga - also due to engine problems.-Additional reporting by AFP and Reuters
