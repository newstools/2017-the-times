The bachelor in question, Thembinkosi, was not the ideal guy for Penelope but she got chosen to go on the date and had to make lemonade with her lemons.Penelope was a likeable character, and on her first appearance, tweeps commented on how pretty she was. She said in one of the scenes that the guy was not her type and her cousin answered by saying that she should rather not be herself because if she did then the guy would end up very hurt.Twitter didn't know how true the cousin's sentiments were until Penelope's true colours came out just a few minutes after her date began.She made snide comments about Thembinkosi's body, financial status and was basically savage with her replies throughout the entire date. Most of her statements were uncalled for and she shredded the guy's ego to pieces on national TV.Tweeps withdrew their compliments, adding that even though she is pretty, she has no right to be rude.Penelope is rude AF. #DateMyFamilyWhat Penelope tweeted last year vs how she was during her actual date. -Double Standards#DmfMzansi#DateMyFamily pic.twitter.com/DoNPSXEXX3Ohh wait a minute.

As soon as people see your ugly personality, they don't see the beauty anymore. #DateMyFamily@PenelopeMachete You go to YouTube to talk abt skin treatment wt are ur plans wit ur Lunch Bar face? #DateMyFamily pic.twitter.com/0nMKpGsezRIt's okay to state an observation, but I don't see the need to be nasty to Penelope. I don't see what good that does. #DateMyFamily
