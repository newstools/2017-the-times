The 24-year-old left-hander, who has fought 97 rounds since turning professional in 2011, is preparing for his 10-round bout against Namibian Vikapita "The Beast Master" Meroro, 32, at Emperors Palace on February 4.Lerena has eight knockouts in 16 wins and the only blemish to his record was a points defeat over 10 rounds to Johnny "The Hurricane" Muller in 2014. Lerena took great joy in avenging that loss when he beat Muller via a 10th-round knockout in April last year.He said he was approaching his fight against the Namibian with extreme caution and will not allow news that Meroro - a former WBO Africa holder from Windhoek - could be rusty after last fighting competitively in May 2015.Meroro - who has flattened 14 of his 28 victims against five losses - last fought when he was knocked out in the sixth round by Dmitry Kudryashov of Russia."He is a very experienced opponent and we take no opponents lightly," said Lerena, whose bout against Meroro will form part of the Golden Gloves "Thunder and Lightning" bill."I am going to win because I am too hungry and I work hard. I have never been outworked. My dedication takes me through my fights. I also have the skills to back it up."A vacant IBO junior flyweight championship showdown between Hekkie "The Hexecutioner" Budler and Joey Canoy from the Philippines will also feature.Ryno "The Lion" Liebenberg will welcome German Enrico Koeling in a rematch. Koeling outpointed the local fighter in their first fight in Germany in October last year. But the verdict was contentious and the two boxers are meeting for the second time to settle the score.
