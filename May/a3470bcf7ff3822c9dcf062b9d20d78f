City Power spokesman Virgil James said there would be a door-to-door inspection at the end of the amnesty period when fines may be imposed.The spokesperson said meter tampering includes any action that results in the breaking of a seal opening adjustment or removal of a meter bypassing a meter opening a meter box interfering with the meter or municipal wiring piping or any other installation in any manner whatsoever. Customers whose meters have been found to have been tampered with are liable for their actions except during the current amnesty he said. If they apply on time they will be pardoned. The utility will not charge anything for normalising the meter but there are other incidences that will see fines. James urged customers whose meters have been tampered with to come forward and use the amnesty period as a window of opportunity to get City Power to normalise their meters free of charge.He said registering the tampered meters during the amnesty period would help customers to avoid penalties such as reconnection fees and average monthly consumption charges for the period the meter has not been vending. City Power s technicians will then visit the premises of the amnesty applicants to normalise the meter.City Power customers will have to produce a rates and taxes statement not older than three months a valid identity document stand number and meter number and present it to the utility for the amnesty application. Customers can apply for the amnesty at City Power s head office in 40 Heronmere Road Reuven Booysens in Johannesburg. The amnesty period began last month and will run for three months in total James said.
