After a mixed start to the season, sixth-placed United are on an 11-game unbeaten run in the league and have closed the gap on the top four to just three points.Hamann believes home manager Jose Mourinho has the best squad in the league and, with momentum on their side, they could be difficult to stop for second-placed Liverpool."United have the most talented squad and once Mourinho's teams get going they can be very hard to stop," Hamann told Sky Sports."In the Premier League I think they'll be a team to watch out for," added the German, who was part of Liverpool's 2005 Champions League-winning side.Liverpool will be without top scorer Sadio Mane, away on Africa Cup of Nations duty, and Hamann believes the Senegalese winger's absence could be one of the reasons Juergen Klopp's side will struggle at Old Trafford."Mane has been one of the most influential players in the first part of the season," Hamann said."So, I think United, who nullified Liverpool at Anfield, might have the edge on Sunday."But while Hamann's Liverpool career is in the past, present day midfielder Lucas Leiva, 30, is considering his future at Anfield, but admits the club's title challenge may keep him there until the end of the campaign.He has made just 14 appearances this season."The situation is not great. It is not something I want for my future, to have not many games," the Brazilian said."I don't want this at my age."
