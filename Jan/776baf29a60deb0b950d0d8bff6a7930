Speaking on Wednesday at the launch of a R400-million waste-to-energy plant mayor Patricia de Lille said the City of Cape Town was working closely with Stockholm the Swedish capital where buses had been running on biogas for years. (We want) to see if we can replicate the methodology they are using where they are successfully producing biogas fuel from sludge from the wastewater treatment plants for their bus fleet she said.Western Cape premier Helen Zille lauded the public-private partnership behind the New Horizons Energy bio-digester in Athlone saying it was a step towards a waste-free future. We are envisaging that we won t have to invest any more in landfill sites. Landfill sites are not clean usually and they create an environmental challenge and they gobble up very precious land that can be used for other things said Zille.Landfills emitted the greenhouse gas methane but the Athlone site which would create 75 jobs would capture and sell it. In this facility you are creating jobs you are creating fertilizers - you are creating gas for energy she said.The plant will convert 500 tons of waste a day into methane carbon dioxide compost and recyclable materials.De Lille said it was an exciting addition to Cape Town s green economy. It really gives us an opportunity to improve resilience and also to grow the economy in our city and in our province she said.Marcel Steinberg CEO of Clean Energy Africa which owns New Horizons said the city produced enough waste to build nine more plants like the one in Athlone. The City of Cape Town has now set the benchmark on how waste management will look 10 years from now he said.Steinberg said the facility would save the city 620 000 tons of carbon a year. Cape Town imports all its gas [but] this facility alone will generate roughly 45% of your local gas needs he said.-TMG Digital/The Times
