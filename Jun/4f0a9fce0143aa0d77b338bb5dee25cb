 It is understood that the driver of the bakkie swerved to avoid a vehicle when he lost control throwing the patients off the back said ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring.He said ER24 paramedics along with other services arrived on the scene to find the four victims lying on the side of the road. The bakkie had come to a stop on the opposite side of the road. Paramedics assessed the patients and found that one of them a 16-year-old boy had sustained numerous injuries and was in a critical condition. The other three patients were found to have sustained moderate injuries. The patients were treated and the critically injured patient provided with advanced life support interventions. Once treated the patients were transported to Thambo Memorial Hospital for further treatment Meiring said.
