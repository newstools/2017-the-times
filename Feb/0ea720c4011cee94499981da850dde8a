Kaunda said that current information indicated that at 10.30pm on Saturday night the Chiliza family at Silahla area in Richmond was attacked by unknown people killing four people including a child. Police said three other family members survived. The motive for the attack is unknown and no arrest has yet been made at this stage with police on the man-hunt for the killers Kaunda said.In another incident in eMatimatolo Greytown three members of the Mkhize family were ambushed by unknown gunmen while returning from a traditional ceremony in the area he said. Three people were killed in the incident. It is shocking that so many lives have been lost in one evening. Again it is clear that the availability of illegal firearms is the key driver behind these evil acts. The murder of a child in Richmond is a further indication of the decline of morals and animal behaviour. I appeal to communities in these affected areas to observe calm and restrain and rather work with the police to bring to book those responsible. The criminals must face the full might of the law soonest so that a clear message would be sent out that KZN is not a lawless province Kaunda said.
