It all started earlier this week when Dr Malinga described Nasty C as a "pawn shop" for apparently keeping things that didn't belong to him.Nasty C hit back with a video in which he lambasted a 'hater' labelling the person as a "f**king gimmick and a publicity stunt".While Nasty C didn't name Malinga in the video he made reference to his hater "pretending to kick down planes on stage," which coincidently is Malinga's signature move.Malinga obviously watched the video and joined the dots himself, because he has hit back with a stinging reply.NEXT TIME WHEN I SEE NASTY C I'll act like im kicking mosquito knowing hes my target lol kidding.
