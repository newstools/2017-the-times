Fresh from his first few months in Ligue 1 where he has slotted quickly into the first team at Montpellier Dolly put through the pass for Thulani Serero that led to Kermit Erasmus s penalty in the first half.He laid the pass again for Tau s super strike to make it 2-0 in the second half.There were other defence-splitting passes including when Serero unfathomably backheeled in front of goal and Eramus was stopped by a strong challenge.Dolly clearly enjoyed his afternoon surrounded by and linking with classy players such as Kamohelo Mokotjo in midfield and Erasmus and Serero up-front.The ex-Sundowns forward said he was excited after seeing the squad for these friendlies.He was asked how demotivating it can be to a squad when players such as Mokotjo and Erasmus become estranged as they had under ex-coach Shakes Mashaba and on the flip side a motivation when they are present. In terms of the squad unfortunately we have no say Dolly said. But ja obviously personally I was quite excited to see Kermit back in the team and Kamo because I ve always looked up to these guys."They ve been playing in Europe and proving themselves. And I think with Serero we built that relationship back when I was at Ajax Cape Town."He came down this week and trained with the team and I think we just clicked again. It s always encouraging for me to come back home and play with these players and just grow and learn from them. And I think having these players in the team and new players like Percy Tau just encourages us as youngsters to try and reach the heights some of the senior players have been reaching. It s just exciting. We re a happy camp and a vibrant team. And we just enjoy each other s company. Bafana meet Angola in East London in a second friendly on Tuesday. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
