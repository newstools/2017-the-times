"The independent ad-hoc tribunal is appointed with immediate effect and is expected to conclude the appeal process within a period of two months " said Joe Maila spokesperson for the ministry.He said Motsoaledi wished members of the tribunal well in discharging their responsibilities. Following the death of 94 mentally ill patients and the resignation of former Gauteng Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu the health ombudsman Professor Malegapuru Makgoba recommended that the head of department and director be disciplined and possibly suspended as well. Makgoba found that 27 NGOs that were used to take the patients were unlawful as they were unregistered.In his findings he found that people died of cold hunger and thirst. The health ministry said it had appointed retired judge president of the North Gauteng high court Bernard Ngoepe as the chairperson for the tribunal with Professor Brian Robertson a former professor of psychiatry at the University of Cape Town and Professor Hoosen Coovadia formerly from the University of Natal to join Ngoepe in dealing with all appeals relating to the ombuds recommendations. - TMG Digital/The Times
