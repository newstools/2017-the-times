Ben Ngubane's sudden departure as Eskom's chair on Monday night and Hlaudi Motsoeneng's firing from the SABC by an interim - but increasingly impressive - board should have many reaching for the bubbly, especially on the back of the bizarre downfall of Brian Molefe.Good riddance to the lot of them. But this is not the beginning of the end. It may not even be the beginning of the beginning of our fight from the claws of capture. Those who are falling are not the architects of our crisis but merely actors in it.The architects sit in Saxonwold, Nkandla and in our cabinet and elsewhere and we will be making a grave misjudgment if we think this spate of falls is the start of a new era of accountability.A resignation or dismissal or whatever happened to Molefe cannot absolve them of the damage they were party to causing. If we believe in the spirit of our constitution and the rule of law we need to see real consequences that should include, where the evidence supports it, criminal prosecutions.Yes, we should kick them when they are down and we should kick them hard.While we are still sceptical of the noises emanating from the Hawks that criminal investigations are now flowing from the notorious State of Capture report, these are encouraging sounds.Of course there are no such noises from the feeble Shaun Abrahams and his National Prosecuting Authority.Yes, it's too early to say that the edifice of state capture is crumbling. It's a hairline fracture at best. But at least it is something.
