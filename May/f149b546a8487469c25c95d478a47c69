Following a 1-0 defeat on Monday evening that saw Mamelodi Sundowns reign at the top of the Absa Premiership limited to four days and Wits go top Mosimane took a dig at Wits aggressive style of play. It s a different game this one. For us to come here and win we have to have the best people. And I don t want to lose players Mosimane said after the game. I don t want to lose Khama (Billiat) and Percy (Tau) now because I ve got five more games. Have you been to Stoke? This is what happens in Stoke. This game is a game of it s own so you let go. It s in the calendar. I budget to lose this one here every year. Because I know what s going to happen. You know their football here. The way they got out and they press you not to win it s easy to play like that because you need the win. But do I want to play like that for 30 games? No I don t. I have to play football. Because I know how we ve been winning the leagues and cups. We played football. So this one is in the budget. Mosimane admitted the turnover of the Premier Soccer League (PSL) leaders in the past week has been almost bewildering as the league is set for the tightest of three-way finishes between last week s leaders Cape Town City Sundowns and Wits. It s just an exchange of leadership at the top I think. You have to accept it Downs coach said. This thing I don t know how it s going to go. It was in Cape Town City s hands then our hands and now it s in Wits hands. It s exchanging. But it s what happens at the end. So we have to try and win against Platinum Stars (on Sunday in Rustenburg) and we have to keep going. I think to be honest Wits wanted it more than us in the first half. They were more hungry. They fought. In the second half at least we tried to play. We got the team back to play. But in the first half we did not play. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
