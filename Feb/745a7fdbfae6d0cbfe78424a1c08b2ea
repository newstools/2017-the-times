A total of 48 contestants from around the country sang in groups of three in front of judges Unathi Msengana Somizi Mhlongo and Randall Abrahams during theatre week at the Wild Coast Sun on Monday.Only 29 made it through to the next round when they will perform solo before the judges on Thursday.Msengana warned contestants that if they forget their lines they will be going home."It's Season 13. You know the drill. It is unacceptable and embarrassing for yourself. Don't waste our time and don't waste your own time."Mhlongo told one of the groups they sounded "as if I needed a pillow" while another was compared to rotting food in the fridge.The judges were visibly moved by the final six who performed Beneath Your Beautiful."It is the biggest show in the country and it takes us this long to understand the calibre we looking for" said a frustrated Msengana.Abrahams praised the groups for taking different approaches to the song but were equally as good."This was quite special."Mhlongo said he was moved by their team spirit."Welcome to season 13 idols " he shouted.One of the contents Gabi du Plessis said it was nerve-wrecking learning the song."We missed breakfast and lunch to learn the lyrics to be able to give off our best."Hadassah Makhoba 23 of Vryburg said it was "awesome but stressful"."I can understand why some would forget their lines. It's songs they know and are used to but because of the nerves they forget their lines." - TMG Digital/The Times
