He has pleaded not guilty.On Friday prosecutor Dinesh Nandkissor said it was impossible that Naidoo's car was travelling at that speed."You want this court to believe that the car hit a curb and collided with the deceased's travelling at 80 kilometres per hour despite the tracker report?" Nandnkissor asked."Those are my findings. It is not my thinking but it's the information available to me that yielded the results " countered Bezuidenhout.Mhere and his friend Kady-Shay O Bryan died in the crash on William Nicol Drive in Fourways Johannesburg on January 31 2015.
