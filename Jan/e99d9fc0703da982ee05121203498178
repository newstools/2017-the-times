Mara's daughter and her boyfriend, Mashele were sitting outside in his car when she heard gunshots."In my mind I was like 'who is still playing with firecrackers this time?' But after the second and third shots, I realised that it was a gun," Mara told the paper.The former Idols SA judge added that she immediately panicked and started screaming for her daughter."On my way to the gate I saw her come in. We checked on her boyfriend who was shot in the arm. He was bleeding profusely. I have never seen so much blood come out of a human being," Mara added.Mashele died in hospital two days after the incident.
