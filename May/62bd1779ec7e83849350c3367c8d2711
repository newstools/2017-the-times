Amor told TshisaLIVE that she was travelling from Pretoria to Johannesburg at around 7pm on Monday evening when a man smashed her window and held a gun to her head in an attempt to steal her car."I am usually so careful but I had stopped at a traffic light near Diepsloot went I just heard this loud bang. The next minute this big man with a jacket over his head appeared next to me in the smashed window. I went into defence mode and just started driving. All I could think about was my children and I just wanted to make sure that I was safe so I could return to them," Amor said.It was only when she was a fair distance from the scene that she realised her bag had been stolen."The man had a gun. I could have been shot or dragged from the car. I could have been raped. I am just grateful that I still have my life. My bag and purse can be replaced but my life cannot," she added.Covered in broken glass, she returned home to her kids, only to find a single white feather laying on the seat next to her."I was protected by an angel, I am convinced. I was protected," she said.She said that she did not understand why God was testing her."I told my family that I don't understand why all of these things are happening to me. I broke my ankle in January and then Joost died in February. My kids have been sick and I have been fighting court cases. It has all happened in the last few months and I don't understand why I am being tested so much," she added.Amor was married to Springbok star Joost van Westhuizen who died earlier this year after a long battle with motor neuron disease.
