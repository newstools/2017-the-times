Zikalala was speaking at the funeral of Umzimkhulu Municipality Speaker Khaya Thobela who died after being shot at his home in Emfundweni near Ixopo last week.His address came a day after ANC voting district coordinator Siphamandla Ngobese was gunned down in Nquthu."Peace loving people of KwaZulu-Natal should not only condemn these killings but should also provide tip-offs to the police. We therefore urge witnesses to bravely come forward with information that will assist us to put these thugs and mercenaries who continue to murder our leaders and civil servants behind bars " he said.He said that the string of murders would "cripple service delivery". We are today sadly adding a name to the seemingly never-ending list of dedicated men and women who have fallen prey to prowling blood thirsty assassins " he said."Less than two months ago we also gathered to bury Sibusiso Sithole the Municipal Manager of the Richmond Municipality who was also assassinated. Many councillors have also been killed in the past few years " Zikalala added."These killings will have far reaching implications on how we deliver services as government if they are not stopped as soon as possible."Zikalala urged anyone with information to come forward and work with police. The province has established a commission to investigate political murders.TMG Digital/TimesLIVE
