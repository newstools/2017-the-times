The new craze is called Bluetooth, after the technology that connects different electronic devices, and was thrown into the spotlight recently after video footage of addicts swopping blood to get high went viral.The practice is simple: users buy a small bag of nyaope and one person injects themselves with the drug. Another person then draws blood from the high person and injects it into himself.Watch nyaope addicts demonstrate how a Bluetooth high is given. The disturbing practice has led to a massive public outcry and saw Andile take to Instagram to speak out."Afrika!!Afrika!! What has gone wrong? Why (is) so much intelligence directed towards killing yourself?" he lamented.He begged for someone to "intervene and save our young people"."This is not right, it can't be right, never. Why is the African child dying like this? Who's to blame? Somebody help our young people please," he wrote.National department of health spokesperson Joe Maila told TimesLIVE recently that the department feared the rate of HIV transmission would sky-rocket with the practice."This creates a huge problem because there are different blood groupings as well which might create other health complications. We need to educate people about the dangers of sharing blood as a society. We need to talk about this everywhere society gathers. We as a department are very worried about this trend he said.
