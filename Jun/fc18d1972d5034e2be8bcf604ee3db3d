The Young Nurses Indaba Trade Union (YNITU) said on Saturday that its secretary general‚ nurse activist Mduduzi Ndlovu‚ has been arrested following clashes with South African Nursing Council (SANC) security officers on Friday. The union said that Ndlovu had intervened when SANC security guards started assaulting delegates scheduled to meet with SANC Registrar Sizeni Angel Mchunu at noon on Friday to discuss challenges facing student nurses.. “Ndlovu’s charges remain unclear up to now. He received urgent medical care at Meulmed Medical Clinic for head‚ right arm and general body injuries following an assault by the outsourced security staff. “The Sunnyside Police Station has refused him further medical care with a neuro-surgeon in Sunninghill Hospital as requested by his family. He was also refused to open a case against SANC and the security company for this brutality and using excessive force‚ which caused grievous bodily harm when he was protecting students who were attacked unarmed‚” YNITU charged on Saturday. It added that Ndlovu had a strong influence in nursing politics and the liberation of the nursing profession‚ and that SANC officials were “determined to frustrate him‚ as that will send shock waves and further trap nurses in fear of speaking ill of the justices by the SANC”. “YNITU will be applying for urgent bail and will without fail take serious legal action against SANC‚ the security officials and the security company involved‚” the union said. - TimesLIVE
