During cross-examination by Safa lawyer Mark Thompson on day three of Mashaba s arbitration hearing on Thursday Chimhavi said the former national team coach s actions were unprofessional unacceptable and overstepped the mark.He said the combustible mentor damaged the reputation of the football association in the infamous rant after Bafana's 2-1 win over Senegal in Polokwane last year.Recounting the events of that day at Peter Mokaba Stadium Chimhavi said Mashaba who looked in confident mood as he interacted with members of his family during adjournments went over the boundaries of their communications policy. He was aggressive he was uncontrollable and his actions were unacceptable and overstepped the mark because the visuals were beamed across the world because of the magnitude of the match " Chimhavi said.Shakes Mashaba with his lawyer Claudio Bollo at his arbitration hearing at CCMA @ntlokom pic.twitter.com/Nj6sgaiFW5 Mahlatse Mphahlele (@BraMahlatse) March 9, 2017Shakes Mashaba with his lawyer Claudio Bollo at his arbitration hearing at CCMA @ntlokom pic.twitter.com/Nj6sgaiFW5"He was unprofessional and his actions put the name of the association into disrepute and in serious reputational damage."I received calls from CNN BBC and other major news agencies on the continent and I did not know what to tell them. We had just pulled off a fantastic win over a tough team like Senegal but instead of basking in the glory he went on an unnecessary tirade at the media and at the leadership of Safa which was completely uncalled for. Chimhavi said Safa employees were bound by a communications policy which they treat as their bible and there are people who have been fired for failing to abide by it.In his cross examination of Chimhavi Mashaba s lawyer Claudio Bollo said Safa does not respect its communications policy and they are using it to get rid of his client.Chimhavi added that Mashaba s relationship with the media had reached a point where it could not be retrieved. There was a time when he called one of the journalists a small boy and this was one of the incidents that really led to the collapse of his relationship with the media."The rest of the media stood by and supported their colleague and I called the sports editors of the main stream newspapers because the relationship was on the rocks."It was a cordial meeting and the coach was happy and smiling after the meeting he said. There is no doubt that there was no love lost between Mashaba and the media and there is no doubt that the relationship was getting worse and worse in fact it was in the gutters."I saw with the articles that appeared in major newspapers following the incident in Polokwane after the Senegal match that his relationship with the media could not be retrieved said Chimhavi.The matter has adjourned and will continue on April 6 7 10 and 11.- TMG Digital/TMG Sport
