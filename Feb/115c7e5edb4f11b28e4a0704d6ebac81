Explaining the exit of the three players on the final day of the transfer window on Tuesday Motaung said central midfielder Mkhabela has been loaned to Platinum Stars to rediscover his form.Mkhabela was among eight signings trumpeted by Chiefs ahead of the 2016-17 season. The 27-year-old arrived from SupereSport United with a solid reputation as a hard-working linking central midfielder and was promptly handed the No.6 jersey of outgoing stalwart Reneilwe Letsholonyane.But he has been loaned out having not kicked a ball in a competitive match this season. We released Enocent on a loan deal to Platinum Stars. Since he arrived Eno battled with an injury and struggled to break into the team Motaung told his club s website. We thought it in the player s best interest to find game time at another club and hopefully regain his sharpness. Chiefs are in negotiations to release goal-shy strikers Manqele who has one goal in 20 appearances and Mthembu with five strikes in 41 games. Manqele and Mthembu have had ample time to exert themselves in the team Motaung said. Unfortunately things didn t go as anticipated. Therefore we are busy negotiating an exit deal with the two players. We hope everything will go smooth and the two players will have a chance to continue their careers elsewhere. Chiefs are busy reviewing other contracts on the back of extending star centreback Mulomowandau Mathoho s deal to 2020. We are working around the clock to review the contracts of Lucky Baloyi Willard Katsande Tsepo Masilela and George Maluleka Motaung said. Proposals are on the table with regard to Katsande and Maluleka. We are waiting for Katsande to return from national team duty [with Zimbabwe at the Africa Cup of Nations in Gabon] to continue with the negotiations. We are looking to finalise Maluleka s deal by the end of the week. Discussions have also started with midfield Lucky Baloyi and veteran left-back Tsepo Masilela.
