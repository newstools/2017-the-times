The party's application to appeal against earlier court defeats has been rejected by the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) which awarded costs to the city council. Since 2014 the ANC and the DA-run city have been at odds over the logo which the opposition party believes was introduced without adequate consultation. The ANC also believed the logo and rebranding process was too costly. In a statement on Tuesday mayor Patricia de Lille she said the city hoped to receive the awarded costs from ANC headquarters at Luthuli House soon."We once again feel vindicated by this decision taken by the courts. We can only hope that the ANC will now stop the pettiness of pursuing this matter " said De Lille. She said the SCA decided the ANC had no reasonable prospects of success on appeal. "We sincerely hope that the ANC will stop wasting the time of the courts. Enough time and money has been wasted on the ANC clearly fighting what has been proven to be a good decision taken by our administration " said De Lille. The ANC leader in the council Xolani Sotashe said the party was still studying the decision and would decide on its next step after consulting its lawyers. - TMG Digital/The Times
