Letshego shared the sweetest picture of them in a fit of laughter that definitely tells a thousand words. "The constant laughs, the beautiful memories are all I hold onto. In less than 24hrs it would have been your 39th birthday. I hope there's a party "up there" although you weren't much of a party person," Letshego captioned the snap.
