Dale Steyn s six-month recovery from breaking his bowling shoulder during South Africa s test series in Australia in November is ahead of schedule. Morne Morkel who broke down with a back injury on the same tour could play his first match since then in the next few days. Vernon Philander is nursing an impingement in his ankle that didn t hamper him noticeably during the test series against Sri Lanka that ended last month. Morkel was the only one of the three who trained with South Africa on Monday. In informal conversations with reporters Steyn said he had been due to start swimming at the end of February as part of his rehabilitation but had not been able to do so since a few days ago. However he was still a way off being able to throw with power and distance. Morkel is expected to play for his franchise the Titans in the opening round of the one-day competition against the Dolphins in Centurion next Friday. Philander said his ankle was improving and should not get in the way of him playing in South Africa s test series in New Zealand next month. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
