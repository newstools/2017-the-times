Khan took to Facebook to complain about his treatment by staff at Jolly Grubber at North Beach after they slapped him with the bill to use the bathroom.He and his cousin were charged R20 each.TimesLIVE previously reported on his Facebook post which read: In my whole entire existence on this earth.. this is the most expensive p*** I ve ever taken... R20 each to use the rest rooms.. That s ridiculous... oh wowwww and to top it off we even received a slip for the facilities used #daylightrobberybutatnight."Khan said he and his cousin had been out for a casual stroll on the beachfront when they needed to answer nature s call. Jolly Grubber was right there and we walked in and as we were moving toward the toilet a manager ran in front of us he said. The guy said there was a charge to use the restrooms and that we would have to pay if we were not customers. We offered to buy drinks but he said that simply buying a drink did not make one a customer. I was so shocked I paid R40 for two of us to use the toilet. I was still charged VAT on this and then I looked at the notice that they had up he added.Khan questioned the price of the toilet visit. I thought R20 was a bit steep and I was dissatisfied about the way I was treated. This is the first time I have seen such a high amount to use a toilet. I work in the food service industry so I know about how to treat a customer Khan said.
