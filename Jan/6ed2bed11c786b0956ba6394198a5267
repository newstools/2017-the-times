ER24 said bystanders were unable to confirm whether the man had been pushed from the train or was surfing when the incident occurred. Shortly before 5pm paramedics from ER24 arrived on the scene where they were escorted by another medical service to the train tracks. The man was found lying near the tracks with severe head injuries. Paramedics stabilised him on the scene and later carried him back to an access point where he was loaded into an ER24 ambulance and transported to a nearby hospital said ER24 spokesman Werner Vermaak.
