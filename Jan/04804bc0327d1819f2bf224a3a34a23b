A security guard has been accused of sexually assaulting some of the school's pupils .He was arrested and charged in March and released on bail and allegedly continues to report for work every day.The man, who is known to The Times, is one of 33 KwaZulu-Natal school employees suspended for sex-related offences committed between November 2014 and November last year.The KwaZulu-Natal legislature has inspected the school on several occasions, and on Wednesday made an oversight visit.It was during this visit that DA MPL Imran Keeka saw the guard at a meeting. The meeting's chairman asked the man to leave.Keeka has called on the provincial education department to take harsh action against the man."I was shocked to find that he attended our meeting. There can be absolutely no justification for this," said Keeka in a letter to education MEC Mthandeni Dlungwane.He said the man must be dismissed.Keeka states in his letter that "this is a breach of his conditions of suspension and it cannot be left without consequence".In its latest annual report, the SA Council of Educators said there were 593 cases against teachers between April 2015 and March last year, and 869 in the corresponding period the previous year.
