The debate and vote will be held next week on Tuesday. But the UDM is seeking direct access to the Constitutional Court before then for a decision on whether a secret ballot can be held.This motion is the fifth against Zuma since 2014 and the fight is expected to be even more intense the Sunday Times reported at the weekendParliament confirmed on Monday that it had been served with legal papers by the UDM. The Speaker received a letter of demand from attorneys representing the UDM for a vote of no confidence in the president to be done by a way of a secret ballot Parliament said in a statement on Monday. Voting procedures in the Assembly are determined by the Constitution and the Rules of the Assembly. Neither the Constitution nor the Rules of the Assembly provide for a vote of no confidence to be conducted by secret ballot and the Speaker has no authority in law to alter such provisions. The Western Cape High Court dismissed an application in 2015 that sought to force the National Assembly to vote on a motion of no confidence by secret ballot.A majority of 200 plus one would be needed for a motion of no confidence to succeed. The ANC occupies 249 of the 400 seats in the National Assembly and the rest belong to opposition parties reported the Sunday Times.No motion of no confidence has succeeded because ANC MPs traditionally close ranks around Zuma.
