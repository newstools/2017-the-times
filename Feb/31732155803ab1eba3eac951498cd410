That s the beauty of this unique fun format where schoolkids get to take on the country s best crews are measured against the world records in their boat classes and age groups.The 2017 edition of this all-comers race is on Saturday.Last year Brittain and his heavyweight pair partner Shaun Keeling ended second behind under-23 single sculls starlet Nicole van Wyk with Kirsten McCann and Ursula Grobler in a double sculls boat finishing third.Brittain and Keeling went on to finish runners-up at the Rio Games while McCann and Grobler took fifth. Van Wyk won silver at the under-23 world championships.Brittain returns on Saturday with a new partner and in a new boat class; he teams up with Kyle Schoonbee who finished fourth in the double sculls at last year s under-23 world championships. It s exciting to have a change of pace said Brittain who will have little trouble adapting to a new partner given he has rowed with a few over the past few years.He s also getting used to the new boat. In pairs he used a single oar now he must use two blades.This is the beginning of a new Olympic cycle but Brittain is looking for early successes. I m not worried about Tokyo [2020] yet but I want to back up my Olympic medal with medals this year he said.His main targets this year are the World Cup series in Europe and the world championships in the US.Rock the Boat started in 2013 the brainchild of Olympic gold medallists James Thompson and Matthew Brittain.In its first year they had 250 entrants and this time they are expecting around 1000.- TMG Digital/TMG Sport
