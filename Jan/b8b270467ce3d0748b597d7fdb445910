While their Absa Premiership title challengers have used big budgets to buy proven talent at this level or pay large wages for free agents Pirates have rather scratched around in search of the next big thing.Times Media Digital looks back at their major signings of the last three transfer windows not including this current January one and assesses their accuracy in the market and whether those players they have brought in have proven a hit a miss or whether the jury is still out.2016/17 SEASON Justice Chabalala: Chabalala looked a raw talent but a promising one in the first half of the season but was then shipped out after six months to Chippa United so we can only assume he did not fit into the team dynamics.Verdict: Miss Sello Japhta: The midfielder did not make a single appearance for Pirates after arriving from Free State Stars and has since been moved on to Chippa.Verdict: Miss Thabiso Kutumela: The 23-year-old arrived with a big reputation having helped Baroka FC to promotion to the top-flight and South Africa to the COSAFA Castle Cup in Namibia in June. But he has made just three starts and scored one goal in six months.Verdict: Miss Jackson Mabokgwane: After having to bide his time on the sidelines following his move from Mpumalanga Black Aces Mabokgwane won a place in the first team in mid-November.His horror error in a 2-1 loss to Bloemfontein Celtic in the final game of 2016 may yet haunt him but it is too early really to say whether his transfer has been a failure. Verdict: Jury s out Mahlatsi Makudubela: Just one start in the first half of the season after arriving from Platinum Stars for a player who will be 27 in six weeks time he should expect more.Verdict: Miss Abbubaker Mobara: Mobara made just one start in the final two-and-a-half months of 2016 and has not yet settled. Perhaps a change in coach will change that but he would have hoped for much more in his first six months at the club.Verdict: Miss Donald Mokondelela: Just two substitute appearances in the first half of the season since arriving from Baroka FC and now shipped off to Chippa.Verdict: MissBernard Morrison: The Ghana forward was a big marquee signing when he arrived from Vita Club in the DR Congo and has been hampered at times by injuries.But he has also yet to deliver a single goal in eight appearances for the team despite showing flashes of his quality. More time is needed.Verdict: Jury s out Nkosinathi Mthiyane: Not a single minute played and now he has been sold back to Chippa after six months.Verdict: Miss Ayanda Nkosi: Three appearances all off the bench though he did score a goal in a 2-1 loss to former club Maritzburg United.Not good enough.Verdict: Miss Riyaad Norodien: Norodien started the season quite well after his move from Ajax Cape Town but became less influential as it wore on.He has at least had quite a bit of playing time.Verdict: Jury s out Thembela Sikhakhane: Featured fairly prominently in the first half of the season though performances blew hot and cold. Showed enough promise to be given more time.Verdict: Jury s out 2015/16 SEASON Edwin Gyimah: Despite a much-publicised airport bust-up with former coach Muhsin Ertugral Gyimah has been a solid performer for Pirates since arriving from Black Aces.His versatility is also an asset.Verdict: Hit Thembinkosi Lorch: Lorch was loaned out to Chippa at the start of this season but after a number of strong performances has been recalled to the Pirates squad.The 23-year-old looks a player of some talent.Verdict: Hit Roger Majafa: A handful of performances last season after arriving from Polokwane City but nothing to catch the eye.Verdict: Miss Luvuyo Memela: Took a while to settle at Bucs but then became an influential member of the first team squad.At the age of 29 he is certainly not one for the future but has done a good job in his time at the club.Verdict: Hit Samora Motloung: Young goalkeeper who has struggled with weight problems and spent time out on loan.Has since joined Cape Town City without playing a first team game for Pirates.Verdict: Miss Gift Motupa: Had something of a super-sub tag last season as he came off the bench to good effect but has been used sparingly in this campaign.The 22-year-old has not made the impact he would have liked.Verdict: Miss Yasser Mugerwa: The Uganda international made just eight appearances for Pirates last season before being shipped out at the end of the campaign.Verdict: Miss Tendai Ndoro: The hottest property among strikers in the PSL Ndoro initially battled at Pirates at the start of last season before finally getting his chance 12 months ago.He hasn t looked back and is in remarkable scoring form with 23 goals in the 2016 calendar year.Verdict: Hit Felipe Ovono: Equatorial Guinea keeper Ovono never looked Absa Premiership quality and why the coaching staff at Pirates insisted on playing him remains a mystery.He is set to depart the team this month.Verdict: Miss 2014/15 SEASON Thabo Qalinge: Now in his third season since arriving from Black Aces Qalinge is still battling to nail down a first team spot.Verdict: Miss Issa Sarr: Sarr has largely been a regular since his arrival from Platinum Stars and does add some steel to the middle of the park.A very useful operator.Verdict: Hit Philani Zikalala: Always brought in as a back-up the experienced keeper was never really tipped to push for the first team.Therefore it is hard to judge his stay as either a success or a failure.Verdict: Jury s out Tshepo Gumede: Spent 18 months at Pirates and in that time made seven stars despite being spoken of as a player of promise.Left for Cape Town City at the start of this season.Verdict: Miss Mwape Musonda: Never was able to nail down a first team place he spent the 2015/16 season on loan at Lamontville Golden Arrows before leaving for Black Leopards at the end of the campaign.Verdict: Miss Siyabonga Mpontshane: He was in excellent form for Platinum Stars which prompted Pirates to make a move for him in January 2015.Has made just nine starts in two years.Verdict: Miss Gladwin Shitolo: Shitolo signed from Jomo Cosmos in 2014. He had loan spells at Platinum Stars and Lamontville Golden Arrows.Shitolo was expected to push for a first team place at Pirates this season but it has not worked out for the 27-year-old.Verdict: Miss Mpho Mvelase: Signed two years ago from Chippa he has made only three starts since.Verdict: Miss Menzi Masuku: A young winger who burst onto the scene with much promise but never quite won the technical team over.Much to his disappointment he was sold to Chippa at the start of this season.Verdict: Miss Siphamandla Sangweni: A forward who was signed in the 2014/15 season but never kicked a ball for Pirates.He is now with Baroka FC in the second half of the campaign.Verdict: Miss Mashale Rantabane: The defender signed after he helped third-tier Maluti FET College stun Pirates with a 4-1 victory in the 2013 Nedbank Cup.Never kicked a ball for the first team.Verdict: Miss Letsie Koapeng:Nomadic midfielder who made just a single sub appearance since signing for Pirates in 2014.Verdict: Miss - TMG Digital
