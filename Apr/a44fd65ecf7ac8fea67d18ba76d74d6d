These were the words of social activist Zackie Achmat at a Freedom Day rally on Thursday in Khayelitsha Cape Town.Members of the Social Justice Coalition Equal Education Treatment Action Campaign and other organisations were united to change our country Achmat told a packed hall. The Guptas stand in the way of that Jacob Zuma stands in the way of that the corrupt individuals in the ANC stand in the way of that. We cannot give up the ANC to Jacob Zuma. Achmat said he wanted every political party except the DA and the Freedom Front Plus to work together against the government.TAC provincial manager Michael Hamnca said the country s problems were exemplified in the proposal to give ex-Eskom manager Brian Molefe a R30-million package. How many houses can you build with that amount? Our health system is collapsing. It is worrying what is happening in the country he said.Social Justice Coalition general secretary Phumeza Mlungwana said: It is the job of the older people to shape us so that we can shape South Africa into what we want. We are here because of your decisions in 1994. We were put in Khayelitsha for a reason. We were put in Nyanga for a reason. * Alexa Cole is on an SIT Study Abroad programme and produced this story in association with Round Earth Media.-TMG Digital/TimesLIVE
