Gumede was quoted earlier on Thursday by SABC as saying that marches against President Jacob Zuma including one led by the DA was tantamount to treason and that anyone who takes part would be arrested.However in a statement issued via the official eThekwini Twitter account this threat has seemingly been withdrawn. Mayor Cllr @GumedeZandileRT said no-one will be arrested or intimidated for taking part in the march. #peoplesmarch the tweet said.The account said that two marches had been planned one led by the DA and the other by the ANC Youth League. It could not immediately be established if the two groups with wildly differing views on whether or not Zuma should be removed from office would cross paths.Either way the municipality has warned that action would be taken if anyone oversteps the mark. Our officers will also be on high alert for any other illegal marches or volatile situations that might arise. People can take part in marches however this may not be done in a way that compromises the rights of others. Those taking part in the marches are cautioned against injuring others and vandalising infrastructure the city said in a series of tweets. Law enforcement personnel will be monitoring the movements of vehicles and to ensure that traffic disruption is minimised. Refrain from injuring law-abiding citizens or blockading roads thus preventing others from going to school and work. Mayor Zandile Gumede pleads with residents to march peacefully and in a legally permissible manner without damaging property.
