S&amp;P s decision came as a relief as it has a negative outlook on SA s sovereign credit rating a warning that a credit downgrade is likely. Fitch on the other hand has given SA a stable outlook. Ratings agencies usually forewarn about downgrades by first lowering their outlook.S&amp;P differs from Fitch and Moody s in that it rates SA s rand-denominated debt a notch higher than its foreign-denominated debt and Friday s statement allayed fears that S&amp;P would cut rand-denominated debt to the same BB+ junk status of foreign-denominated debt.Moody s which originally had its ratings report on SA scheduled for April 7 delayed its verdict after S&amp;P decided June 2 was too long to wait after President Jacob Zuma s March 31 Cabinet reshuffle in which Pravin Gordhan was replaced by Malusi Gigaba as finance minister.S&amp;P cut its rating of SA s foreign-denominated debt to BB+ and its rand-denominated debt to BBB- on April 3.National Treasury responded by saying: While S&amp;P has lowered its rating of foreign currency-denominated debt to a sub-investment grade rand denominated debt which constitutes 90% of the debt portfolio retains its investment-grade rating. Moody s has historically been more bullish about SA than its two largest rivals rating SA at Baa2 which is equivalent to BBB in S&amp;P s and Fitch s nomenclature.If Moody s cuts SA s sovereign rating a notch to Baa3 as is widely expected this country would remain in investment-grade.While Fitch did not lower its outlook or downgrade its rating on SA in Thursday s statement it did list many concerns about this country. SA's general government debt at 52.6% of GDP in March 2017 is above the 'BB' and 'BBB' category medians of 51% and 41% respectively. We expect debt to continue rising over the next two years
