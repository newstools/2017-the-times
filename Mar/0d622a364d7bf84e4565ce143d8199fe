"We are resolute in this " Malema said as the party's lawyers carried in several boxes of legal documents into the court building.The Economic Freedom Fighters want the court to rule that Parliament's speaker Baleka Mbete order action be taken against Zuma.The EFF along with the United Democratic Movement (UDM) and Congress of the People (Cope) are pushing for the court to force Mbete to call for a vote of no confidence in Zuma or to have impeachment proceedings instituted.Malema himself handed over the documents to the registrar of the court.Section 89 of the Constitution says a president can only be impeached by the National Assembly in Parliament as a result of a "serious violation of the Constitution or the law".The section also allows for the removal of a president for "serious misconduct" or an "inability to perform the functions of office".
