That's according to Ntuzuma Taxi Association chairman Velaphi Gumede, who was speaking after a taxi carrying 21 schoolchildren crashed into an oncoming bus in Ntuzuma, outside Durban, yesterday morning.Four pupils - one from Sibonelo High School and three from Sivananda Technical High School - were killed and about 20 people were injured.Gumede said inspectors who monitor taxi drivers in the area attempted to flag down the driver, but the taxi did not stop."They told me when they tried to stop this taxi they suspected of overloading, but the driver ignored them and sped off."Moments later it caused this accident," Gumede said.Police have opened a case of culpable homicide, but no arrests have been made.
