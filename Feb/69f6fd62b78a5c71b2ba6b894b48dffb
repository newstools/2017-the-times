Like all lovers they just had a tiff, AKA has said on Twitter. You know maybe AKA wanted to hang with the boys and B wanted to watch movies. Maybe next time they'll keep the tiff behind closed doors? I love you @bonang_m ... I'm just a bit crazy &amp; intense .... I'm sorry baby. We good.Ya so what. Couples fight. Get over it. Life goes on.A similar scenario played out last year with the rapper even deleting all Bonang's pictures off social media.
