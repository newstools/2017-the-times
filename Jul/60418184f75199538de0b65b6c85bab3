Metropolitan’s bold new TV commercial pushes the limits for marketing communication in the financial services. The #ISeeYou campaign was recently launched to promote a culture of positive recognition - of really seeing what people are managing to do with their money and their lives on a daily basis. Watch the ad here: Directed by Sunu Gonera of Egg Films, the commercial features Spoek Mathambo, a huge success in his own right as a singer, songwriter, rapper, producer & DJ, as the voice of the campaign. Mathambo drives the viewer through a powerful lyric that praises the journey of hard-working individuals: “To the people who make every day a success: I See You.” Metropolitan’s head of brand and marketing Llewellyn Allen, is proud of the fact that the campaign reawakens the essence of what Metropolitan is. “We unashamedly believe in the people, clients and country in which we operate,” he says. “It’s time we give people a positive sentiment that celebrates all that modern African success can mean. We want to recognise people, everyday people, on their personal journey to success and say, ‘Hey, we see you and together we can do this!’” Allen says the goal was to attach strong and positive sentiment to the #ISeeYou expression and he is incredibly proud of the work. “It’s an exceptional campaign which signals us as a modern African company celebrating modern African success in a very South African way.” Other people featured in the campaign include:
