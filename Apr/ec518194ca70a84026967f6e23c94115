The former world No1 was surprisingly given a wildcard for the Stuttgart Grand Prix, which started on Monday.Sharapova's 15-month ban for taking an illegal substance ended yesterday and the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) has been falling over itself to get the five-time grand slam winner back on court.She got a wildcard because she doesn't yet have a WTA ranking following her ridiculously brief absence from the game.The Court of Arbitration for Sport fell for her story about ignorance in taking the drug meldonium, which is not available in the US but popular with some Russian athletes (no surprises there). Meldonium is a dodgy drug, manufactured in a dodgy factory with dodgy experts testifying for Sharapova.The 30-year-old's story that she took meldonium because of a family history of diabetes and was unaware that it was banned is so spurious it makes you want to reach for some antiemetics.The International Tennis Federation informs players each year through e-mail of substances that are banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency.Sharapova, a Russian, said she had not clicked on the link.Her original two-year ban was reduced by the court and it would be nice to think that the leniency was about sympathy for an ignorant young woman.But it is all about the money.Sharapova was the richest sportswoman in the world before her ban. She was richer even than Serena Williams, 35, who is a far better tennis player.In 21 clashes between the two, Williams has won 19, is ranked No1 in the world again, has won 72 career titles to Sharapova's 35 and has $84-million in prize money to Sharapova's $36-million.And yet Williams needed Sharapova to be removed from the scene before she could be No1 on the rich list.Why would Sharapova have been richer?Could it be that Sharapova is cooler, taller, has longer legs and long blonde hair? Just asking.For all our political and gender correctness, sex apparently still sells.It's one reason that makes it not hard to understand Sharapova's quick comeback today.Porsche sponsors the Stuttgart Grand Prix . and Porsche also sponsors Sharapova.And it's not just about fast German cars.Before her ban, Sharapova also had Nike, Evian, Tag Heuer and a range of other companies at her feet, paying her more than $20-million in yearly endorsements. In return, she offers them exposure."Sharapova is more than familiar; she is ubiquitous," said the Financial Times before her banning.Those sponsors want to get back on the Sharapova brandwagon.They will be queueing outside the Stuttgart dressing room today. Now where are those antiemetics?
