But it is also worth noting that straight win/loss stats do not tell the full story while some coaches were involved in a lot of friendly games with the likes of Swaziland Botswana and Lesotho others spent the majority of their tenure playing some of the top nations in the world.We list the top five Bafana Bafana coaches based on their record in the job.1. SHAKES MASHABATenure(s): Oct 92 April 01 Aug 02-Nov 03 Sep 14-Nov 16Record: P58 W32 D21 L5 GF94 GA40Win/loss percentage: 55%Mashaba holds a number of national team records from his four spells leading the side (two as caretaker) including most games in charge most wins goals scored and goals conceded.He lost just five of his 58 games at the helm of the national team not including penalty shoot-outs though in the end he was perhaps undone by too many draws.It is worth noting that he never led his side against a major power from outside of the African continent something all on the list below did. 2. CLIVE BARKERTenure: Mar 94-Dec 97Record: P43 W22 D9 L12 GF57 GA38Win/loss percentage: 51%Barker took over a team that was struggling on their return to international football and turned them into African champions within just a few years of readmission.During that time he also engineered draws with powerhouses Argentina and Germany and saw his side come within a whisker of upsetting the mighty Brazil.He was axed late in 1997 having led Bafana to the 1998 Nations Cup and World Cup finals but had to hand over the reigns before he could test himself on those stages.3. TROTT MOLOTOTenure(s): Oct 98-Sep 00 Apr 02Record: P34 W17 D9 L8 GF43 GA31Win/loss percentage: 50%Moloto was named coach after the axing of Phillip Troussier following the 1998 FIFA World Cup and inherited a very good team.He led the side to the Nations Cup in 2000 where they finished a reputable third but did not fair so well against the likes of USA (0-4) Mexico (2-4) and Ireland (1-2) at the Nike Cup which sewed the seeds of his dismissal in 2000.He did set the side on the path to qualification for the 2002 World Cup.4. CARLOS QUEIROZTenure: Oct 00-Mar 02Record: P20 W9 D7 L4 GF20 GA15Win/loss percentage: 45%Queiroz would go on to manage Real Madrid and Portugal (for the second time) as well as have two successful spells as assistant coach at Manchester United after he was booted from the Bafana hot-seat following the 2002 Nations Cup.South Africa had lost to hosts Mali in the quarterfinals but had also clinched their spot at the World Cup finals in South Korea/Japan.Queiroz s first game in charge was a 0-0 draw to France while aside from Mali two of his other four losses came away in Italy (0-1) and Sweden (0-3). 5. CARLOS ALBERTO PARREIRATenure(s): Jan 07-Mar 08 Oct 09-Jul 10Record: P36 W16 D13 L7 GF49 GA25Win/loss percentage: 44%Brazilian Parreira was no tactical genius but he had a plan for Bafana and high up on his priorities was to make them among the fittest sides at the 2010 World Cup something he achieved.They gained four points from their three matches at that tournament but it was not enough for a second round spot while the team also exited in the first round of the 2008 Nations Cup under Parreira s watch.He did make Bafana tough to beat and were it not for their nightmare night against Uruguay in the World Cup maybe he could have looked much more favourably as a Bafana coach. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
