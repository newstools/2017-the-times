Eight hundred people will be provided with accommodation a mattress blankets ablution facilities and meals before and after the race. The project has been part of the Comrades for the past 16 years. I m grateful I don t have worry about these things. Last year was a stress for me. I can concentrate on completing the race said the four-time silver medalist.Silver medals are awarded to runners who finish the race in between 6 hours and 7-and-a-half hoursChris Fisher general manager of the Comrades Marathon Association said: Through this initiative we have been able to accommodate runners across the socio-economic spectrum and afford them an opportunity to experience the race. It has given them an opportunity to dream. Runners had to submit applications early in the year.Karen Thomas Old Mutual s Head of Brand said many runners dreamt of competing in the Comrades but could sometimes not get to the start line. We want to ensure that those runners who might not be able to afford the weekend in KwaZulu-Natal now have a chance to be part of this special day on the South African running calendar.
