Gauteng police spokesperson Captain Kay Makhubele said police were investigating a case of house robbery and kidnapping."There was a robbery and the people were taken away from their home. They didn't report for work today and that's when people from work went to look for them " Makhubele said.He said when people arrived at the home in Northcliff the place was turned upside down.A post on the I Love Northcliff Facebook page by Simone Raghunath pleads for help to find them and asks anyone with information to contact the family."Please spread and share this guys. This is my sister uncle and step mother. Every second counts right now " the post said.Raghunath said the family was too upset to speak publicly at this stage and would be commenting at a later date.Makhubele said anyone with information should contact the Sophiatown police station.
