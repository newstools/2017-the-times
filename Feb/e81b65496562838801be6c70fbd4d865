The City of Johannesburg has condemned the death calling it an act of "senseless violence".Nico de Jager the member of the mayoral committee (MMC) for Environment and Infrastructure Services Department said the security officer had encountered suspects excavating cables."The security officer managed to call for backup and upon the arrival of the response team contingent a shootout ensued and the security officer was declared dead on the scene by paramedics " De Jager said.The suspects fled to a nearby informal settlement."This act of senseless violence must be condemned in the strongest regard and I will along with officials from City Power be visiting the family of the security officer to express our condolences " he said.About 45% of power outages in the areas where City Power operate are caused by cable theft according to De Jager."The fight against theft and vandalism is an ongoing battle that costs City Power millions of rand every year."In a bid to combat cable theft City Power is replacing copper conductor cables with aluminum ones.
