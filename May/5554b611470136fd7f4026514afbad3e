The parastatal s board announced on Friday that Molefe was returning to it following his resignation last year after being implicated in the public protector s State of Capture report.Save South Africa and the opposition parties were speaking at a joint media briefing in Johannesburg on Friday.Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane said: "Brian Molefe does not belong in parliament. He was never an honourable member. He does not belong at Eskom. He should face criminal charges."[This is] our stance collectively. We all agree that we can't allow someone who is facing being criminally charged facing a state capture report to return to Eskom."It's quite clear we have a Gupta-run state. It's quite clear that the sovereignty of our nation has been donated to private interests of a family " Maimane said.He said Parliament should deal with Eskom in the same way it dealt with the SABC."These are state resources and require an inquiry to deal with Molefe alone ... it requires some form of interdict to say Molefe can't go back to Eskom. Ultimately like his boss he should face criminal charges.The Freedom Movement said Molefe's reinstatement at Eskom had come as a shock."As far as we are concerned Brian Molefe's name has not been clean. He remains a corrupt human being who must be far away from any office of leadership said the Freedom Movement's Prince Mashele."We are consulting also with lawyers and we are going to wait for advice in that regard. We are going to interdict."He said it seemed that the Gupta family had decided to bring Molefe back to Eskom so they can loot state resources."We think this is an insult to the people of South Africa " Mashele said.
