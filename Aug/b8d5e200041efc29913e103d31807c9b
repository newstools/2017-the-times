Not even one of the biggest soccer matches this past Saturday could stop Itumeleng Khune from attending ex-girlfriend, Sbahle Mpisane's star-studded Umemulo dinner party on the same night. Sbahle celebrated her Umemulo (a traditional coming of age ceremony) with a grand dinner that was attended by some of Mzansi's famous faces including Khanyi Mbau, Norma Gigaba and First Lady Thobeka Zuma.
