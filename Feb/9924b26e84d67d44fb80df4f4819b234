Dr Jeanne Tarrant of the Endangered Wildlife Trust which organised the #ForFrogsSake event aimed at raising awareness about the plight of the amphibians said some of the schools arrived more than an hour late because of poor service from the municipal bus service. Leapfrog event planned to save frogs with a giant hopThe event was due to start at 10am but only got underway at 11am - with some bus loads of children only getting there closed to midday. "In the end we had about 770 children jumping all together which is still pretty good. I think it's a South African record " she said.The current record is 1 348 people taking part simultaneously which happened in New Zealand in 2010.When the other children arrived they played their own game but it did not count towards the world record attempt. Organisers had hoped for 1 500 children to take part. Despite this Tarrant said she was still happy that the objectives had been achieved.'It was great to get the learners out there. It was a diverse group from all over Durban " she said.- TMG Digital/TimesLIVE
