Then there was the procession of hapless Sri Lankan batsmen who gave themselves guilty verdicts while Philander reaped the rewards on the least responsive Newlands surface he has played on since his test debut.It was fitting that it was the scene of his 150th test wicket even though it was hard work despite Sri Lanka being skittled for 110. This is the home of cricket and it is a ground where I really enjoy playing my cricket."I couldn't have asked for a better place to take the milestone wicket but hopefully there are more wickets that I can take in my career going forward."I just happen to cherish every wicket I take for my country Philander said. You want to take wickets with the new ball and that really sets the tone for the match."You know as a bowler there will be spells where you put the ball in the right place and you reap the rewards."Kyle Abbott and I have invested well in the new ball."You don't always get the rewards but we invested well and the rewards followed. Abbott's wicketless but miserly eight over contribution was as important as Philander's 4/27.There was a constant drilling of pressure from both ends and the relentlessness of the South African bowlers wore down the visitors.There was also the small matter of Philander having to deal with the furore surrounding Abbott's impending Kolpak drama with Hampshire.The discretion in which he dealt with the issue could have been handy for Sri Lanka but Philander said players who make the decision to play abroad need to have their wishes respected. Its a personal decision players make for themselves and that's something we need to respect as fellow players."If they find that's something they could take forward in their career then by all means you have to take that path."It's a personal decision taken by a player and we respect that Philander said. You find that it's silly season in regards with things like those but that's something he needs to deal with Cricket South Africa."I'm in no position to comment about the matter. CSA will do all the commenting in regards with that matter. - TMG Digital
