The 19-year-old pupil was among those who worked day-and-night to catch up on lost days of schooling after residents of Vuwani shut down the area for several weeks in 2016 over unhappiness with municipal demarcation."I worked really hard that is no lie. When the strike hit I knew I have to come up with a strict study plan and it paid off " he said.Following the torching of 20 schools in the area some pupils were sent to special camps outside of the community while others slept over at schools for weeks preparing for exams.Despite the interventions Ravele was still worried about his future.But when the results were announced at Vhafhamadi secondary school in Ha-Mashau village he was elated.Ravele waited anxiously sweat building up on his face as principal Mashau Thenga called out the names of pupils to collect their Grade 12 statements of results at an assembly held at the school.Thenga then started reading out top percentages in Mathematics (96%) Physical Science (84%) Geography (78%) Life Sciences (87%) then called Ravele's name as the achiever of the marks.Covering his face with his hands in disbelief the 19-year-old came forward to claim the fruits of his toil as parents peers and teachers gathered in assembly showered him with applause whistles and ululations."I feel like a heavy load has lifted from my shoulders. I cannot wait to give [the results] to my parents. I was confident of the outcomes because of the amount of work I put in " he said shaking with joy.He attributed his success to self-driven hard work sacrifice and dedication for his bachelor degree admission.Ravele said there were three pupils in his study group and at the heart of the strike they managed to cover two chapters of each subject and would set tests for each other to assess their understanding of a subject.He said some of the questions they tackled came up in the exam and it was a breeze.Ravele said when the protest hit the area and schools shut down they panicked which resulted in them devising their own study plan which they stuck to religiously."Now we are all smiles having achieved bachelor degree passes. The two others got a distinction each " he said. Ravele is heading to University of Pretoria to study Mechanical Engineering.Out of a total of 147 pupils that sat the matric examinations at the school 89 passed 32 of these with bachelor passes.Karabo Raswiswi 18 bagged a distinction in mathematics saying "What more could I ask for? I am thankful for all the support I have received from my parents teachers and the community as a whole".Standing next to him was Rhulani Hlongwane also 18 who achieved a distinction in accounting as well as 75% for mathematics and 68% for economics."I cannot stop looking at the results. I am so happy " he said.But Thenga is not so pleased with the schools 60.5% pass rate as he had aimed for 70%.The principal said that in previous three years the school achieved pass rates above 70% but he was comforted by the increase in bachelor passes."We achieved a 45% bachelor passes. That is good. We had lots of programmes in place extra classes and weekend study sessions as well as three-week camp. But 43 learners did not attend and this contributed to the failure rate " he said.At Maligana Wilson secondary school also in HaMashau where learners camped at the school they aimed for an 80% pass but managed 76.8% according to a senior staffer who did not want to be named.The school was among the worst damaged in protests with a fire destroying everything except the school's administration block.Of the 138 pupils that sat for exams 96 passed with 24 bachelor passes 32 diploma and 40 higher certificate admissions.But the staffer was also not happy saying those who were progressed from grade 11 did not attend the extra classes which were tailored for them and this contributed to the failure rate."We could have achieved a higher pass rate had they taken part. For the class of 2017 my message is hard work hard work and more hard work " she said. To check your results visit http://matric.sowetanlive.co.za/- TMG Digital
