Talib, who shot to fame as a member of US hip-hop group Black Star, has always had a keen interest in South Africa, commenting several times on the issues facing local hip-hop.Sadly, that didn't stop trolls from questioning his credibility in South Africa and asking if anyone in SA even knew who he was before his collaboration with Cassper.Talib managed to defend himself and also raced to Cassper's rescue as a hater accused the rapper of being "trash" and an "illuminati puppet".I knew from blackstar but this @CassperNyovest is horrible to me ponytail illuminati puppet Poloko Gaobusiwe (@HITEOINSTITUTE) June 4, 2017I knew from blackstar but this @CassperNyovest is horrible to me ponytail illuminati puppetwhole new previous album of @CassperNyovest are trash include the new one with feature of Black Thought this boy kill SA hiphop Poloko Gaobusiwe (@HITEOINSTITUTE) June 4, 2017whole new previous album of @CassperNyovest are trash include the new one with feature of Black Thought this boy kill SA hiphopIn his response Talib said that Cassper was "dope AF" and a pioneer in African music."He (Cassper) was one of the first African artists to ask for a feature," Talib added.He had earlier described Cassper as a "genuine dude, doing him, not bothered by the success of others".Cassper re-shared the compliment on his Twitter page and shot off a series of tweets about only being concerned by the love of his fans.Of course, Cassper is not the first artist in the world to be accused of being part of the Illuminati. But next time you think of coming for Cassper, think again - he's got Talib in his corner!
