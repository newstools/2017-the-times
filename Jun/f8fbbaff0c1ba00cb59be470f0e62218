Serge Kalala said baby Emmanuella was doing fine. She and her mother Francina were discharged from Hillbrow Hospital on Thursday afternoon. My wife was scared. I was scared too. We prayed and she and the baby are now fine. Kalala said his wife started having labour pains in the early hours of Thursday morning. We went to Tshwane Hospital at 4am but they chased us away. They told us they did not have any beds available. They referred us to Steve Biko hospital. They also chased us away. We then took the Gautrain to Joburg to go to Edenvale hospital. When we reached Park Station my wife gave birth. She and the baby were taken to Hillbrow Hospital Kalala said. At 7h30 a train driver informed our Operating Control Centre that a passenger was in labour on the platform at Park Station said Gautrain spokesperson Kesagee Nayager. ER24 was immediately contacted and the ambulance arrived shortly thereafter at 07h50. By then the station staff had already assisted to deliver the baby girl who was obviously intent on not waiting for the paramedics to arrive said Nayager.
