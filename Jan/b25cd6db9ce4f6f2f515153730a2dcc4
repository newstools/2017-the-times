 I'm pleased with 67 but I feel if conditions are like that for the rest of the week I can definitely go lower he said.Earlier in the day (at 7.10am to be exact) the 10th fairway was lined when McIlroy teed off in the first round of the SA Open.The masses came to see the former world number 1 (now No2) and the four-time Major winner didn't disappoint.His round included seven birdies and two back-to-back bogeys on the par four fourth and fifth holes. It also featured a monster 392-yard drive on the first hole that had onlookers gushing.He shares second place with South Africans Thomas Aiken and Dean Burmeister. Aiken showed no cobwebs after a five-week lay-off over the festive season. I prepared for a week for this event but last year was a long year. A lot of travel and I felt pretty tired. I'm in a good space mentally said Aiken.He closed with five birdies in a row. Luckily I didn't have to do too much with the putter. The greens are a little tricky because they've sped up since Tuesday. It was a view shared by McIlroy. I played on Tuesday and nothing yesterday (Wednesday) and the greens have firmed up quite nicely. It took me by surprise in a couple of wedge shots I hit into the first couple of holes."It skipped on a little. It required a bit of adjustment. Burmeister's round featured five birdies an eagle on the 15th but regrettably also a double bogey on the par four 12th.Another Northern Irishman Darren Clarke carded a two under 70 along with George Coetzee.Tournament host Ernie Els shot 74 in a round that included three birdies and five dropped shot. Defending champion Brandon Stone also shot two over. - TMG Digital
