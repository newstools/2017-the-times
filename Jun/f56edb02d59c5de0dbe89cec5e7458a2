Interim DA Western Cape leader Bonginkosi Madikizela confirmed the meeting saying it was aimed at communicating the decision of the party s federal executive.DA leader Mmusi Maimane shocked many when he announced on Saturday that Zille was suspended from participating in party activities following a meeting of the federal executive. But the party soon backtracked saying Zille was instead given 72 hours to state why she should not be suspended by the party. Said Madikizela: We are meeting...[to] brief the caucus so that everyone is on the same page. We don t want to assume that everyone has heard or read the statement that was sent out by the fedex he said. He said the meeting was to clarify the decision on Zille to all members of the caucus. Madikizela said if the party decided to suspend Zille she would only be able to participate in meetings that dealt with the running of government which included caucus meetings. Zille confirmed she would attend Monday s meeting and participate like any member of the caucus in the province. She however said she would only submit her letter stating reasons why she should not be suspended on Tuesday morning. Asked how her suspension would affect her in doing her job she said she didn t think it would as she could still meet with members of her cabinet. I can obviously continue to attend Cabinet meetings whatever decision the fedex takes which is the crucial thing I need to do in terms of my job as Premier. I am taking advice on the situation with caucus meetings. Other meetings are not essential said Zille. Asked if pressure brought about by her upcoming disciplinary hearing was affecting her she said: I am very used to pressure and so I take it in my stride. My work has continued without missing a beat. The first sitting of Zille s disciplinary hearing will be held in Parliament on Friday this week.TMG Digital/TimesLIVE
