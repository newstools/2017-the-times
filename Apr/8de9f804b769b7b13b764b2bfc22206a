Both Emtee and Nasty C had fans wondering if they had been involved in a "record label reshuffle" last weekend, only to reveal that they had been working on a music video together.The pair are currently two of the hottest hip-hop artists in SA and they used the video to prove why they won't be modest about it.Here are three clear indications that Nasty C and Emtee ain't here for you, they're here for the guap and the music fam:Every king needs a castle... a real castle:They didn't settle for the usual suburb mansion and pool site party, instead opted for a huge castle, fit for royalty. Then they show you how to dine like kings:Although we guess when you are the king, like Emtee, you can carry your signature Styrofoam cups anywhere. If you are a hater, they will call you whether with a brick of cash or music awards:Remember that brick of money Nasty called his haters, now he uses his Metro FM awards. Emtee also used his awards, this against background footage of both of them accepting their awards.
