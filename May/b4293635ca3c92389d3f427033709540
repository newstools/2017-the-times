Matsatsantsa a Pitori will face the high-flying Cape Town City on May 9 as part of their five remaining fixtures.That game will be eagerly watched by Mamelodi Sundowns and Bidvest Wits as the outcome will have an impact on their quest for league honours. We (the top five teams) are all playing each other Tembo SuperSport's assistant said. I think that we also have a say in terms of who will win the league."We still have to play Cape Town City at home. It all depends on how far we can go in terms of scrapping results here and there."We are approaching the business end of the season. Each and every team is scrapping for points because even down there it s not easy. SuperSport should have Stuart Baxter back in the bench when the club hosts Bloemfontein Celtic at Lucas Moripe Stadium on Wednesday.Baxter missed the club s win over Bidvest Wits and draw with Kaizer Chiefs due to illness.He will be a welcomed return as the Briton has had a positive impact at SuperSport taking a struggling team and turning them into Nedbank Cup champions just four months into his tenure.He will be looking to retain that trophy as the Tshwane side are in the semifinal of that tournament. We are getting better and better as a team Tembo said. The players are starting to understand what Stuart Baxter our head coach wants from them. You can see in how we defend and attack."We have a lot of good moments going forward. I think there s been quite a big improvement from last season. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
