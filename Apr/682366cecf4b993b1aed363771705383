DA finance spokesman David Maynier said on Sunday that these were exactly the kind of reckless statements that undermined investor confidence and discouraged private sector investment which were desperately needed to boost economic growth and create jobs in the country. The minister says that Professor Chris Malikane has been reined in and told to keep quiet . But Professor Chris Malikane says the minister cannot tell him to keep his mouth shut . Up until now Professor Chris Malikane has made a fool of the minister by ignoring his instruction to keep quite . However things have now come to a head: Professor Chris Malikane crossed a red line in our constitutional democracy when he pivoted from warning about civil war to calling for 'civil war' in South Africa. Speaking at an event last night Professor Chris Malikane reportedly suggested that people may have to take up arms to achieve radical economic transformation in South Africa Maynier said. The fact is that it is complete madness for the minister s economic advisor to be allowed to suggest that people take up arms to achieve radical economic transformation in South Africa. These are exactly the kind of reckless statements that undermine investor confidence and discourage private sector investment which are desperately needed to boost economic growth and create jobs in South Africa Maynier added.He said Gigaba must now try to save himself by acting decisively to stop the bleeding by immediately making a public statement distancing himself from his economic advisor s mad ideas and firing Malikane as his economic advisor at National Treasury. In the end the minister can run but he cannot hide from Malikanegate because I will be holding the minister s feet to the fire for his reckless decision to appoint Professor Chris Malikane during Question Time on Wednesday 10 May 2017 in Parliament Maynier stated.
