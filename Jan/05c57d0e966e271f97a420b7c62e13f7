Now academics at Stellenbosch University have found that a technique that involves inducing shivers and shakes quivers and quakes can help them to deal with the stress of working in high-risk schoolsThe psychologists Sharon Johnson and Anthony Naidoo tested three stress-relief approaches on 43 teachers from four schools.All the techniques had benefits but the neurogenic tremors advocated by US doctor David Berceli and depicted in numerous YouTube videos yielded a significant reduction in teacher stress .The so-called trauma release exercises induce tremors. The physiological changes are said to have a psychological knock-on.The other stress-relief techniques in the study taught in group sessions for a total of 15 hours over 10 weeks focused on stimulating the limbic system in the brain with song dance and massage to bring about heart coherence and calmness ; and a more traditional cognitive and behavioural approach that involved group discussions and role-playing.Writing in the South African Journal of Psychology Johnson and Naidoo said: All interventions were designed to deal primarily with issues of learner discipline the greatest reported stressor of teachers in the study s high-risk schools. The trauma release exercises allowed teachers to release tension in their bodies and perceived stress levels to be reduced. They were better able to handle learners in a more prosocial classroom. -TMG Digital/Sunday Times
