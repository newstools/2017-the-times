They brought the grand total of recorded Ford Kuga fires to 43. That's an incendiary number for a single model in any country, let alone a relatively small one such as South Africa.This matter offers a narrative that the media are naturally drawn to: Unsuspecting consumers as innocent victims of a great big, rich multinational.But, the truth is, the story should by now be old hat. It should have been consigned to history weeks ago with some adroit customer relations, media spin and humble pie.But those darn cars keep bursting into flames.It's time for Ford to admit it has a large problem on its hands. There is a widespread perception that it has tried to dodge responsibility in this case. Take a look at the Kuga owners' Facebook page and you'll see the litany of woe that keeps flowing.This is a textbook case of poor PR. The company's strategy for communicating with its customers is clearly wanting. Many have not been notified of the vehicle check-up recall that has been belatedly issued.One woman relates how her complaint to a dealership about sudden unexplained bursts of acceleration from her Kuga elicited an insulting sexist comment about "women drivers".Ford's initial responses to our inquiries on the series of fires were perfunctory brush-offs.After a National Consumer Commission investigation, Ford started to show a little more interest but a deeply worried frown and an open-hearted concern are still not in evidence.We can't help but notice the contrast with Ford's response in the US to Donald Trump's outburst about the company's plan to build a car factory in Mexico instead of creating jobs on home soil. It immediately cancelled the $1-billion Mexican plant and ploughed the money into an existing factory in the US.You could say its efforts in this country are an attempt at smoke and mirrors. But, sadly, there's no smoke without fire.
