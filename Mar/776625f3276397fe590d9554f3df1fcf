A small marquee had to be erected outside.Sithole, who was due to start his new job at uMngeni Municipality in Howick next week, was gunned down in the Richmond CBD on Monday morning, igniting fears of renewed political tension in the once strife-torn Midlands town.Inside the hall a who's who of local government - including mayors and municipal managers - ANC and alliance partner leaders, DA officials, academics, farmers, municipal employees and residents were united in grief at his passing.Speaker after speaker recounted how Sithole had changed their lives, and the lives of those who had come into contact with him.Mpilo Ngubane, on behalf of municipal managers and the Institute for Local Government Management, praised Sithole for the work he did both as the provincial treasurer of the organisation and Richmond's top official.Under Sithole, the small council received two clean audits."We wish to know these people who are killing us and tell them we are not fighting," said Ngubane."He was a fine young man, a leader and an intellectual. Even if you never agreed on something he never lost his smile," said Richmond mayor Joe Mchunu.
