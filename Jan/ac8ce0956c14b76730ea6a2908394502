Taking to social media the singer's revealed that they had been receiving missed calls since the weekend."Family we have been getting missed calls from this no since Sunday they even called around 12:10am. So they have all our numbers cause they called us both. So yesterday I decided to call the no thinking maybe it's a booking of some sort, ohh calling was a BIG mistake," read a statement from the singers. Bongi and Collin were shocked by what they heard when they returned the call. "On the other end of the line there was two women talking about an abusive boyfriend theres also crying in-between, all this happen in less than a minute. Then the phone cut off." It was then that they realised that it was a scam because R110 airtime vanished after less than a minute on the phone. The gospel stars hoped that sharing their story would stop others from falling prey.
