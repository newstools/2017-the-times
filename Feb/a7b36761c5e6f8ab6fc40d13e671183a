"My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by Nordstrom," Trump said in a tweet. My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person -- always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible! Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017 My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person -- always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!"She is a great person -- always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!"Trump sent out the remarks shortly after speaking to a gathering of local law enforcement agents where he delivered stark warnings about the dangers of terrorism.The retailer, which has about 350 stores in the United States and Canada, said last week it was dropping Ivanka Trump's line -- which includes high-end women's clothing, accessories and shoes -- due to poor sales.Representatives of the upscale retailer did not immediately responded to a request for comment from AFP about the twitter attack.Nordstrom said in a statement last week that its decision was based purely on commercial merit and came as part of its regular review of the 2,000 brands it sells."In this case, based on the brand's performance we've decided not to buy it for this season."Since his surprise victory in November's elections, Trump has used his Twitter feed to lambast companies for off-shoring US jobs or overcharging the federal government for aircraft.But the latest tweet was different in that it sought to defend part of Trump's family business empire, which critics have said could be a source of profound conflicts of interest for the White House.Unlike other companies he has attacked on Twitter, including Lockheed, Boeing and Ford, Nordstrom stock was up slightly at middayNordstrom was one of several retailers that faced boycott calls for selling Trump family products or supported the campaign.Anti-Trump activists created "Grab Your Wallet" after the election to enlist consumers in boycotts to protest Trump's agenda, which also has been met by waves of demonstrations inside and outside the United States.
