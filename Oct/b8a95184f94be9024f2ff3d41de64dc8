When I can't get the gym,Â I do a lot of body weight exercises, which are simple, effective ways to improve balance, flexibility and strength without machinery or extra equipment. This is especially great when travelling for shoots, so I have no excuse not to train. You can literally do it in the comfort of your bedroom. It is a combination of 30 push-ups, squats, lunges, jumping jacks and plank. I repeat the combination a couple of times - great for a heart pumping, sweaty work-out - and ideally aim for a 30-minute session. When I can get to the gym I focus on weight training and to keep my heart rate up I do supersets. Typically, the two exercises work different muscle groups and I find it is the most effective way to build muscle and burn fat. I really enjoy running, especially on a beautiful summer day. This winter, to keep my cardio fitness in check, I did a combination of running and cycling using the gym equipment. I enjoy food guilt-free and I don't believe in diets. A protein shake is beneficial for me as a midday snack in lieu of a meal, especially when time is short.
