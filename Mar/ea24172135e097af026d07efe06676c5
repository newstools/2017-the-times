The position of Deputy Chief Justice became vacant as a result of the retirement of Dikgang Moseneke.Zuma said on Friday he had chosen Judge Zondo and was consulting political parties as well as Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng about the appointment. Justice Zondo has served as a Judge of the Constitutional Court since 2012 and has previously served as Judge President of the Labour Appeal Court.EFF leader Julius Malema said on Tuesday he had written to Zuma to overturn the decision."We are not opposed to Justice Zondo as a judge. As a matter of fact we have great confidence in him. However it is our strong-held view that a chance must be given to a black woman to inspire and advance the gender struggle against patriarchy."This is a reinforcement of comments by EFF spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi on Friday night. He said: We believe in his integrity and seniority as he has indeed been serving in the Constitutional Court already. He deserves to be in the highest court in the land as a seasoned judge and as a man of integrity. However it is inexplicable why Zuma would ignore the acting Deputy Chief Justice Bess Nkabinde who has been serving in the Constitutional Court longer than Justice Zondo. Above all in the interest of advancing the gender struggle why ignore a woman well qualified with integrity and who is already acting in the position?..." Less than a month ago Zuma argued that South Africa is ready for a woman President. Yet when opportunity is ripe to appoint a woman Justice to the high position of Deputy Chief Justice he does not said Ndlozi.See Malema's letter here:CIC @Julius_S_Malema's letter to Zuma Rejecting his Intention to Appoint Justice Zondo as Deputy Chief Justice of ConCourt pic.twitter.com/csm0pRVzDW EFF Official Account (@EFFSouthAfrica) 7 March 2017 CIC @Julius_S_Malema's letter to Zuma Rejecting his Intention to Appoint Justice Zondo as Deputy Chief Justice of ConCourt pic.twitter.com/csm0pRVzDW
