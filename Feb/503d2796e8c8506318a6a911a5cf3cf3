Anita Ronge from Joburg is a white local house DJ going by the name The DuchAz or Kasi Mlungu. The DJ started trending after she shared on Twitter that she gets bashed for embracing 'blackness."She made an appearance on the Twitter trends list on Wednesday afternoon after debates over her motives divided Mzansi.Some felt she was "parading blackness" to make money. "Black people are jailed, shot at, caged, placed in coffins for being black," but Kasi Mlungu "tweets to earn the same respect," wrote someone.The problem is she calls herself black and gets fame from being called #KasiMlungu. Not her being a house DJ. @EusebiusAt the same time some defended her saying that some "black women attempted to be white with weaves."Does house music belong to black people now? Njani? Please relax guys, she is an African of European descent #KasiMlungu cc @Eusebius"I get rejected for not being black enough and being too black to be white ... I'm #KasiMlungu &amp; I'm proud," said Anita after she first started getting backlash.
