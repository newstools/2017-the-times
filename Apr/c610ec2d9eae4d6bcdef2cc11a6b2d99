Tinkler also said defeats would provide potentially devastating blows as the PSL log positions are very tight. Any defeat right now is a bad defeat he said on Tuesday as his City side wound up their preparations for Wednesday s top-of-the-table clash against Bidvest Wits at the Cape Town Stadium. It is all so tight nobody wants to be dropping points right now."Even at the bottom of the table if (bottom placed) Baroka win twice they will be up in the top eight. I still believe teams are going to be dropping points."I certainly don t think they ll be running away with it."It s going to be a tight close scenario that in itself tells you just how important the three points on Wednesday are going to be Tinkler added. Wits are the best team in the league and they stand the best chance of winning it."So it will be a tough task for us but we have the self belief. Tinkler s team sit top of the league standings with a one point advantage over Wits but have played two games more. We are backing ourselves."I think (Wits coach) Gavin (Hunt) will be happy to go home with a point but obviously in the back of his mind he is looking for all three."They have a lot more big games to come. I think they ll play a direct game with lots of balls into out box."He will see that as one of our weaknesses so that is why we have worked hard this week to try and improve that department. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
