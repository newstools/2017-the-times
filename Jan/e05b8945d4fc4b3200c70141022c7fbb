These were the words of Phillip Roodt in a post on Facebook as he described the scenery whilst on holiday in Kwazulu-Natal. The Limpopo resident is the latest social media user to face a severe backlash after posting racist comments.Roodt said the sea looked like a tar road filled with potholes in his recent post which described black people as cockroaches who vacation on stolen money from taxpaying white people. He ended his commentary by adding Hope the f*****s drown one by one. His comments which were captured in a series of screen grabs and shared widely follow a year that saw several Facebook users express their disdain for black people.TMG Digital has not been able to contact Roodt.Last month Vanessa Hartley from Hout Bay said that black people were stupid like animals and should be tied to a rope. Sandton resident Ben Sasonof said that the Durban beachfront smelt like the inside of a part of President Jacob Zuma s anatomy.In May last year Matthew Theunissen following Sports Minister Fikile Mbalula s ban on certain sporting codes from hosting major international events because they failed to meet transformation targets said our government are a bunch of k*****s go f**k yourselves you black f***ing c***s .A year ago an infamous post by Penny Sparrow went viral after she wrote These monkeys that are allowed to be released on New years Eve And New Years day on to public beaches towns etc obviously have no education whatsoever .The Umzinto Equality Court ordered the 68-year-old to pay R150 000 to the Oliver and Adelaide Tambo Foundation after she was found guilty of hate speech.She was ordered to pay the money within 60 days but failed to do so. She was back in court in September where she pleaded guilty to crimen injuria charges and this time was fined R5000 or 12 months imprisonment in addition to a two-year prison sentence suspended for five years on condition that she does not commit a similar offence.She has subsequently applied for leave to appeal but did issue an apology in court saying I wish to make a public apology for my thoughtless behaviour. I have hurt the feelings of my fellow South Africans. I realise that what I have done is wrong. I am very sorry . - TMG Digital
