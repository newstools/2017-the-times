Naidoo appeared briefly in the Randburg Magistrate’s Court on charges of reckless and negligent driving and culpable homicide. His case was postponed to October 30 because his instructing attorney‚ Luando Vorster‚ took ill. Mhere and his friend Kady-Shay O’Bryan‚ who was a passenger in the car Mhere was driving‚ died at the scene of the accident on William Nicol Drive in Fourways‚ Johannesburg‚ on January 31‚ 2015.
