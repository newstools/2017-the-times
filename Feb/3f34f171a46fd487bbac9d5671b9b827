It neatly summarises his presidency and his barely concealed contempt for the standards of a constitutional democracy.It is impossible to see any practical reason for the deployment of 400 soldiers when 6,000 police personnel are being rolled out.To put this deployment in perspective, in 2015 South Africa sent 400 troops to the Democratic Republic of Congo to support the UN mission there.In 2001, South Africa's first post-apartheid foreign deployment of troops saw 240 first-wave soldiers sent to Burundi.Now nearly double that number will be on the streets outside parliament. For what purpose?The only possible interpretation is that this decision was motivated by political considerations and was intended to send a clear message.This is a blunt and bullying message, uncomfortably reminiscent of the Big Man syndrome which this continent was happily laying to rest.The Constitutional Court seemed to predict this turn of events when it ruled in May in the case the DA brought against the National Assembly's Speaker."Tyrannical rule is usually at the hands of the executive, not least because it exercises control over the police and army, two instruments often used to prop up the tyrant through means like arrest, detention, torture and even execution."Even in a democracy, one cannot discount the temptation of the improper use of state organs to further the interests of some within the executive."Our president would appear to have given in to temptation.
