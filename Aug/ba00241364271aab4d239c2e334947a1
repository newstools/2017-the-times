How often do you travel? Locally, very often. Everyone wants jokes. Your earliest memory of travelling abroad? Probably around 17 years ago. It was my first gig in London. I tipped everyone ₤15 because I figured it was like R15. People were very nice to me after that. What do you need for a perfect holiday? A minister of finance who stays in his job for longer than 60 minutes. That helps the rand. Favourite holiday destination? Thus far, Zanzibar. Everything looks exactly like the brochure at Flight Centre. Beach, cocktails, boat trips. Bring it on. Best holiday ever? Durban, when I was 11 years old. We stayed at the Royal Hotel. I firmly believed we were overseas. Most relaxing destination? I felt quite relaxed in Istanbul. The city has an otherworldly charm that intrigues me. I was also intrigued by the fact that I was mistaken for a male escort. Favourite restaurant? Asian Food and a good curry is my thing. So in Cape Town, I'm a fan of Chef Pon's Asian Kitchen, Yindee's and Maharajah. Favourite city? New York, New York. You're there, but you can't believe you're really there. And then you hit the streets and totally start acting like you're a movie star. Surreal. Favourite hotel? Any hotel that upgrades me to one of those fancy suites. Does not happen often enough. But when in Joburg, I'm quite taken with hotels in the Rosebank area. Most adventurous travel experience? India. The locals kept pointing at me and shouting "Sai Baba!" I spent a great deal of time sprinting past the River Ganges. What's your one travel essential? Leave-in conditioner. That Instagram filter can't fix everything. Best piece of travel advice? At some point, stop converting the prices and just have fun. Call centres can't find you abroad. Where next? Amsterdam, Prague, Paris. Over 12 days. I'm not excited yet. The world has gone mad. Who knew I'd feel safest Cape Town? • 'Hashtag Lottering' is on at Pieter Toerien's Montecasino Theatre in Joburg until September 19.
