The Finn, fresh from his first victory with champions Mercedes in Russia, is the man most likely to become the 11th different winner in a row at the Circuit de Catalunya.No other track on the calendar has had such a variety of winners over the past decade.Last year it was Dutchman Max Verstappen, 18, who became the sport's youngest winner when he triumphed for Red Bull on his team debut.Ferrari's championship leader Sebastian Vettel and Mercedes rival Lewis Hamilton will start as favourites and success for either could be an omen because both went on to take the title the last time they won in Spain.But Bottas, who joined Mercedes in January as replacement for 2016 world champion Nico Rosberg, is the best bet to continue the streak of different winners in Spain."Getting that first win definitely gives me a lot of confidence," he said after Sochi."And now it's done, I just want to do it again and again ."The only other driver from the leading trio of teams yet to triumph in Barcelona is Verstappen's Australian teammate, Daniel Ricciardo, but Red Bull has lagged Mercedes and Ferrari on pace so far this year.But that will surely change, with the flow of upgrades set to speed up now that teams are closer to their factories, and Red Bull have some big chassis modifications in the pipeline and engine improvements still to come."I hope the upgrade will give us a chance to really fight with Mercedes and Ferrari, or at least get us closer," said Ricciardo.The driver of car No11, Force India's Mexican Sergio Perez, has racked up 14 successive points finishes and he, too, will have aerodynamic updates on his car.Of the current driver crop only Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen and McLaren's Fernando Alonso have won twice at Barcelona - with their first victories in 2005 and 2006 respectively.Alonso will consider it a bonus to get as far as the starting grid on home soil, having failed to make it even that far in Sochi before his car broke down in his last race before heading to the US and the Indianapolis 500."I'm not sure what we can expect from this weekend," said the Spaniard."We're expecting some new parts, but we can't really focus too much on performance until we have solved our reliability issues," Alonso said.
