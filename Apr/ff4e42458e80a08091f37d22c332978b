 Is an Anti-Racist South Africa Possible was the theme of the discussion hosted in partnership with the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation.University of Pretoria s Professor Christi van der Westhuizen said: When it comes to confronting race white people should address it and take on other white people for racism."Academic Sithembile Mbete agreed but said black people with access to capital and state power would also have to make sacrifices and spread the benefits they had received from being accepted into white supremacy.Anti-apartheid icon George Bizos was applauded for calling for a country that was accepting and inclusive .Former Robin Island prisoner and anti-apartheid activist Khehle Shubane said a race free South Africa was possible but added that prejudice and racism came from an unequal society. "There is no reason why post 1994 government has not done what should have been done."South African society has been sharply divided by many racist incidents.The South African Human Rights Commission dealt with 505 complaints about racism in the 2015-2016 financial year an 82% increase in complaints from the previous financial year.The commission is on record saying it was deeply concerned that more than 20 years after democracy it still received complaints about discrimination on the basis of race. While efforts have been undertaken in law policy and the establishment of institutions such as the Equality Court racism still remains an issue in South Africa.
