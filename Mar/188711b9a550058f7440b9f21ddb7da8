It's an uncomfortable mark of the human condition that so many of us take guilty delight in the gory detail and unseemly revelations of such interludes in our public life.From the team that brought you the Oscar Pistorius blockbuster and the Shrien Dewani smash-hit, comes.the Van Breda family slayings.This one is tantalisingly set in the up-market luxury of the De Zalze Golf Estate in the Western Cape and has an axe-wielding assailant at its black heart. A formidable security set-up, injured siblings, a suggestion of mental instability, bemused coppers; oh yes, this should grab the imagination.But there's the rub. Any anticipation is tinged with a worry that South Africa's notoriously bungling cops will once again embarrass us in the eyes of a watching world.In both the aforementioned trials, silly errors by the SA Police Service were to the fore and could have swayed eventual outcomes.In the De Zalze case, it took the police more than 18 months to make an arrest. This was despite glaring clues that had everyone in the country playing the sleuth and coming up with the same prime suspect.The police have been remarkable quick on their feet in recent politically linked cases, yet they seem to lack the same zip when it comes to plain old-fashioned killing.The fact that the illegal mining industry - exposed in our paper today - has been allowed to grow and flourish in violation of umpteen laws is just one example of this country's selective policing.Let's hope, as we listen intently to some brilliant legal jousting over the next while, that the slapstick "Keystone Cops" don't spoil it all - not to mention derail justice.
