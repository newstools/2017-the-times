We hope the municipalities will come up with a sustainable payment plan and thus avert further interruptions for its citizens " said Eskom group executive for customer services Ayanda Noah.In spite of the fact that both the provisions of the Electricity Regulation Act 4 of 2006 and supply agreements with the municipalities empowered Eskom to disconnect electricity completely Eskom has opted for a softer approach of interrupting electricity during certain hours in the day Noah added.
