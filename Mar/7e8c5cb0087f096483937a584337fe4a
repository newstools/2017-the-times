Everyone knows that AKA and Black Coffee have an icy relationship, so haters used the weekend's events to take aim at AKA."Black Coffee you are really worldwide, levels and the world is yours. Now congratulate this baddest on his victory lap and composure," tweeted one user.Only thing is he has zero F's to give.In fact AKA said that the only reason haters have been "trolling" him was because he had no failures.At least we all know AKA is feeling himself!Why do people do this the obsession ..... it's too much! https://t.co/Eza3O0RCsSPeople have no failures of my own to troll me with so they troll me with other people's successes because they have none.
