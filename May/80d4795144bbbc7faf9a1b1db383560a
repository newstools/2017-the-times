Vavi said this at a media briefing in Johannesburg on Monday following the newly formed federation s first national executive meeting."A radical socio-economic transformation will ensure that the people shall share in the country's economy while addressing the triple crisis of poverty unemployment and inequality " he said.Saftu also called for the nationalisation of banks "especially the Reserve Bank".Addressing the issue of farm killings he said: "We are calling for an end to farm evictions and abuse of farm workers. Affordable housing for all including the option to use pension funds as collateral."The federation called for illegal miners known as zama-zamas to be regulated. "We have seen the appalling news that the death toll in the Welkom mine disaster has risen to 40 and could still rise further and we are still shocked at the low priority that the media has given to such a colossal tragedy " said Vavi."Don't blame the victims blame the capitalists who abandoned the mines and seemingly have no plan to close the mines. There is poverty in the country and it takes an extreme level of desperation for one to go there."The federation committed to rendering a quality service to its members through a "service charter".The new federation was conceived over two years ago in the wake of the expulsion of National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa from trade union federation the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu).
