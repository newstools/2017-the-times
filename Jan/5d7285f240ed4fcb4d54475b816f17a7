ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said the four men were trapped when a river flooded during heavy rains. SAPS search and rescue donned their wetsuits while community services diverted most of the traffic. ER24 assisted the rescue teams using rescue throw-ropes to retrieve the four men. After a short few minutes all four men were brought to the nearby banks where they were assessed by ER24. Fortunately no one sustained any injuries Meiring said.
