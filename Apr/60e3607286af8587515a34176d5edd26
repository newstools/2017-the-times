Nasty C's mother died when he was just 11 months old and all he has left are a couple of pictures and memories that others have told him.Yet when he sits down with us to talk about his life, he speaks of his mother as if she had spent his whole life with her."I lost her at a very young age but I still feel very connected to her. I feel her spirit with me in everything I do and in every project I try and honour her," Nasty C told TshisaLIVE.It was no surprise then that when Nasty decided to make his film debut on a short music video documentary that he would eventually name the project after his mother."I shot the film and when I looked at the finished product I was so proud of it. I knew that my mom would be proud too and I've always wanted her to see me at my best so I decided to dedicate it to her," he reveals.Although the film did not tell the story of his life, the songs which were included on the film were written based on experiences he had growing up.The rapper said that he did not have a particularly difficult childhood but puts that down to have a strong determination to make it as a rapper. Unfortunately his father wasn't too happy with the idea."My dad always provided for me but he spoke down on my music when I was like nine or ten. At that age I didn't know how I would be come a rapper but I knew that was the only thing I wanted to do."When you are young, you think that the older generation doesn't get it. You think that they are trying to make you forget your dreams, and so I was determined to prove my father wrong and I found my voice through music and developing this fighting spirit," he said.
