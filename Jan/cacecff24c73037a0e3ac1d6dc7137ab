Sylvester achieved international fame for escaping twice from the Karoo National Park and last year he was moved to Addo near Port Elizabeth and confined to a 200-hectare area.South African National Parks said on Tuesday that Sylvester and another male were freed on Saturday afternoon a day after two lionesses. Sylvester is already showing signs of being the pride leader on Sunday night chasing the females off their kill said Addo conservation manager John Adendorff adding that he had followed that up by killing an adult black wildebeest on Monday. Now that it appears he finally has a place where he belongs without threat and the fact that he has bonded so closely with the younger male we are confident that Sylvester will have no need to ever stray again. His satellite tracking collar location is monitored regularly and easily provides us with an accurate assessment of where the two are. Sylvester escaped by going under an electric fence in 2015 and went on to kill 28 sheep a cow and a kudu.He was recaptured after three weeks but escaped again last year sparking fears that he would be put down. After a public outcry he was instead relocated to Addo.-TMG Digital/The Times
