The Lion King producer and musician Lebohang "Lebo M" Morake has achieved a lot in the over 20 years he has been in the industry and has fought many battles, but his biggest fight is against SA's obsession with blessers. Lebo M has found his private life in the headlines several times over the last few years because of his relationships. He said that the country should be focused on the "blesser culture" it has instead of judging him. "I think we need national therapy. We are a society that condones and glorifies a blesser, which, in my view, is sophisticated prostitution, and then a guy like me who has only been married four times [he married the same woman twice] becomes a villain. It's like a f*cken' taboo for me to build a family and try to build myself as an individual." "Stop focusing on me and worry about blessers. I mean, look at me, who is married, and then look at a f*cken' blesser. What are we trying to teach our kids? It is not about me, I don't care, but if we want to make heroes out of people who destroy young women, something is morally wrong with us," he said.  As a father, he said it was surprising how young men often interacted with women by effectively buying them. The star made the headlines earlier this year when it was claimed that he had gone broke. He told TshisaLIVE that he had simply reorganised his businesses and filed for a US court chapter 11 order, which protected him against creditors for a limited time to allow him to do so. "There is a difference between bankruptcy and chapter 11. I am happy. There was a need to realign the financial structure in Los Angeles based on a number of things but it was a strategic realignment. It was a rearrangement of an incoming new infrastructure that is handling my business management."
