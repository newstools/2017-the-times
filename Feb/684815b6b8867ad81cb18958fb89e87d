Rhoda Afrika has grown her flower business from just a single stall to becoming a major supplier: She will be supplying thousands of flowers to around 40 stores on Valentine s Day.Afrika a third generation flower business owner originally from Cape Town moved to Bloemfontein a few years ago with the hope of finding new opportunities to grow her business. After successfully setting up and running a few outdoor flower stalls she was contracted by a retailer in 2011. She now supplies to over 15 Shoprite and Checkers stores regularly and up to 40 stores on special days such as Valentine s Day. Flowers are my passion - they have been in my blood from a young age. There is so much love in flowers because they help us to mark so many different occasions in life. It gives me great joy to know that I can spread this love to so many people this Valentine s Day and on all the special days we celebrate " she says.
