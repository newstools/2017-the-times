Mashatile was giving a progress report to the communities of ward 119 and ward 24 which include the Naturena Freedom Park Slovo Park Elias Motswaledi Siyaya and Daveland communities.He said he was in agreement with the community that land was needed as it was a key issue that liberation movements fought for. People need land for housing farming businesses for schools and churches it is important. But land invasions are not accepted because they delay development. It is hard to dig and put services in land that has been invaded he said.The MEC also said when the community identified land it must come up with a proposal of how it must be used and government would check who owns it.He said that all spheres of government would work together to develop it and put in services. Once we have identified the land we are going to put in services such as water electricity sewer and roads the allocated sites according to the list. We are doing this so that those who can afford are able to build themselves houses. We are not going to wait for RDP houses but for those who cannot afford to build even when given land government we will build for them Mashatile said.He added that the department was investigating allegations of corruption in the housing allocation in Freedom Park. Mashatile called on communities to report corrupt leaders because they would suck the community until it is dry . We are aware that some communities are paying certain individuals during land invasions and we urge you to stop it because the people you are paying do not own the land and they will not do anything for you he said. Mashatile said he would engage with other government departments to resolve other challenges in the community such as the need for another high school in the area and a bridge for primary school pupils crossing from Freedom Park to Naturena.
