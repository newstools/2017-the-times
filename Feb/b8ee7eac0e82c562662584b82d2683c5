The drug-resistant form of the disease can kill up to 80% of those it infects and requires two years of complex treatment with expensive medication that can cause deafness and nausea.South African and US scientists researched how 404 patients in KwaZulu-Natal had contracted the disease and published their results recently in the New England Medical Journal.They asked patients whom they had come into contact with, and sequenced the genes of samples of TB bacteria to find related clusters.Until now doctors had thought that drug-resistant TB bacteria, which are resistant to six medications, evolved from ordinary TB bacteria that had survived an inadequate medication regimen.But their analysis of the data showed that 69% of patients were infected with drug-resistant TB by other people, and at least 30% of the 404 patients were infected at a hospital or at home. South Africa has one of the highest burdens of tuberculosis and drug-resistant tuberculosis in the world, the report said. In the past decade, the number of cases of XDR [extremely drug-resistant] tuberculosis has increased by a factor of 10 to more than 1 500 cases in 2012. Researcher Nazir Ismail, who is head of the National Institute for Communicable Diseases Centre for Tuberculosis, said: The spread of drug-resistant TB is worrying and is true to the nature of TB. It is spread through close, sustained contact with an infected person sharing the same air. But Ismail said the risk of being infected by the highly resistant strains of the disease was low in the general population.- A South African researcher spoke about the possibility of a cure for drug-resistant TB at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, in Seattle, in the US, last week.Johannesburg s Francesca Conradie s study, NIX-TB, found that a new treatment with two new drugs and an older antibiotic, used on 69 extremely drug-resistant patients, cured most of them.Conradie s work is r evolutionary , said Wits Reproductive Health and HIV Institute director Francois Venter, who attended the conference.
