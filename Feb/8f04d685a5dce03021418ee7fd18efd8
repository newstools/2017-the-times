The television presenter whose Twitter bio reads as TV Journo at eNCA. Neurotic. Flies under Fire. Devoted to gripping television news dove face first into a Twitter bashing when she seemed to either not know who some of the prominent politicians arriving were or lacked grace and decorum yelling for someone to call Helen Zille .A scathing Twitter storm ensued with many questioning the journalist s credentials. Here are ten tweets that got news station eNCA trending for all the wrong reasons: Wow! This eNCA lady is awful; #SONA2017 NdimhleFcukedUp (@JackDevero) February 9, 2017Wow!
