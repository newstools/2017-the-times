Jordaan entered both the race for a seat on the Fifa inner circle as well as that of African Football s governing body but stunned last week when he withdrew from Fifa race.Becoming one of Africa s seven representatives on the all-powerful Council had long been a cherished dream for the Safa boss and although he insists it was a tactical move it is an unconvincing and inconceivable that he will have pulled out of a race just as he was about to win.His decision to pull out of the Fifa Council contest came just hours before Fifa released a list of those who had passed integrity checks before the election.Jordaan said he wanted to go the Caf route first but now faces a tough race for one of two seats on offer for the southern African region.One of the seats is being vacated by Ahmad of Madagascar and the other is held by former Council of Southern Africa Football Associations (Cosafa) president Suketu Patel of the Seychelles who is running again.Jordaan Rui Eduardo da Costa (Angola) and Frans Mbidi of Namibia are the three other candidates.Ahmad who uses just one name was a shock winner over Jordaan four years ago at the 2013 Congress in Khartoum but is not standing again because he is contesting for the CAF presidency.Integrity checks conducted by FIFA were for candidates for FIFA Council elections only. CAF do not have integrity checks for their own elections but plan to bring them in from 2019 onwards.This is one of several changes to their statutes that the CAF Congress in Ethiopia will be asked to vote on in Addis Ababa on Thursday. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
