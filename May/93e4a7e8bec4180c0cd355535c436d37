The "One Belt, One Road Initiative" was unveiled by President Xi Jinping in 2013.Xi will host top officials from 28 nations for the two-day conference on the outskirts of Beijing, though few Western leaders will attend the meeting.Beijing's grand vision includes the "Silk Road Economic Belt", which extends from China to central Asia through Europe, linking northern Xi'an city with Dushanbe in Tajikistan, Moscow, Rotterdam in the Netherlands, and Venice in Italy.The "21st Century Maritime Silk Road" is a maritime transport route that plans to connect China's east coast with Europe via the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean.The initiative spans about 65 countries representing 60% of the global population and around a third of global GDP. The China Development Bank alone has earmarked $890-billion for about 900 projects. Here are some of the initiative's projects:The port will provide China with safer and more direct access to the oil-rich Middle East than the waterway trade route it currently uses through the narrow Malacca Straits.A new international airport will also be built in Gwadar. Central to the project in Pakistan is the renovation of a 487km road that is part of China's only land passage to the Middle East.
