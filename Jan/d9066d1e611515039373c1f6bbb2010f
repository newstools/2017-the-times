The pupil was allegedly assaulted by his principal in Middelburg Mpumalanga late last year after he was accused of stealing R150 at the school. I was equally shocked and very saddened when I saw the news. It [corporal punishment] is outlawed. It s assault. These are the reason why we outlawed corporal punishment. It s one of the saddest stories for the day and we will work with the province and see what we can do. The assault on the pupil is criminal and went beyond corporal punishment Motshekga said. It saddens me and I am extremely disappointed that there are still such incidents.
