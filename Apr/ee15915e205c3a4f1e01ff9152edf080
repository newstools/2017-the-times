This comes after the Constitutional Court allowed parties to file opposing papers in the United Democratic Movement's urgent application on the motion of no-confidence debate against the president.The court issued directions to all political parties wishing to oppose the UDM's application.The party approached the court on Monday after National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete refused its request to have the voting on the motion conducted by secret ballot.The Constitutional Court has given parliament until midday tomorrow to file papers.The UDM, as the applicant, has until Wednesday next week to reply.After that, all parties have to file their written submissions by April 21.This is according to directions issued by registrar Kgwadi Makgakga.Parliament said yesterday that it had received the directions."Parliament will comply with the directions and time frames issued by the court," a brief statement said."The court has not yet taken a decision to either hear or schedule the application," parliament noted, adding that no injunction had been made by the court about the debate.
