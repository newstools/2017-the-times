Speaking to Anele Mdoda on Real Talk with Anele, the rapper said he honestly preferred a simple life and he just happened to be "famous". "I am not a celebrity, I know celebrities. I don't feel like I am a celebrity because l try not to be a celebrity. Like, I enjoy living a normal life," he said. He said he prefers that "his music be celebrated instead of him." The 24-year-old rapper has worked with various artist including creating a joint rap album with AKA. Anatii was recently announced as one of the ambassadors for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
