 We want the truth to come out and those responsible to atone for this trauma Joshua s grandfather Hamilton Pharaoh said in a statement to Times Reporters. We pray that the truth surrounding his death will allow all of us to find solace and closure Joshua had been climbing atop one of the display military vehicles at the Klein Karoo National Arts Festival (KKNK) in Oudtshoorn when he reportedly fell into the vehicle hitting his head on a metal plate.South African National Defence Force (SANDF) officers on scene were at the time assisting other children according to SANDF spokesman Mafi Mgobozi. These officers were responsible for guiding children through the vehicles one at a time. Mgobozi said officers acted quickly contacting medical services immediately after Joshua fell.Joshua was transported to the Life Bay View hospital in Mossel Bay where he underwent surgery which was ultimately unsuccessful. Joshua died at 2 am on Sunday.As of Monday the military exhibition was still taking place allowing visitors to step into the back of the vehicles but no longer climb to the front where Joshua fell.The Pharaoh family chose not to comment on the SANDF s decision to continue operating saying their main focus is on remembering Joshua. Officers were allowed to return to duty Monday despite an ongoing board of inquiry by the SANDF. Mgobozi did note that one officer was reassigned to his home base. The officer who found the boy was very upset and has since returned to his base. Other officers have remained at the exhibition and continued on with our demonstration Mgobozi said.Police spokesman for the southern Cape region Captain Malcolm Pojie said the department was conducting its own investigation and would be performing an autopsy Tuesday to determine the exact cause of death.-TMG Digital/TimesLIVE
