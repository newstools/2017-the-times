Angry commuters missed early morning flights and accused the taxi drivers of bullying tactics in their protest which appeared to be directed at rival service Uber. .Department of Basic Education spokesperson Troy Martens was one of those stuck in the gridlock. I m in standstill traffic on the R24 towards the airport for about 45 minutes now. I m about to miss my flight. Boarding time is at 6:30 and it s 6:28 now. A fence had been torn down so cars can make u-turns. PICS: SUPPLIED I can tell you one thing for sure I will not ever support a metered taxi again. And it has only made me more resolute to use Uber taxis. It s completely unacceptable bullying tactics by the meter taxis she added.Aki Anastasiou tweeted:Avoid the R24 in both directions heading twds &amp; from ORT.
