President Jacob Zuma wanted to announce free education as early as February this year, but was stopped on his tracks by National Treasury, when Pravin Gordhan was still finance minister. The Sunday Times can today reveal that Treasury officials intervened by removing the free education announcement in Zuma’s state of the nation address in February.
