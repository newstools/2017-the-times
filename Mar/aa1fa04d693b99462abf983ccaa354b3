The letter has not been edited. Greetings fellow countrymen and global citizens.I write this short letter to all South Africans and why they should know who really this parasites that use a funeral of a freedom fighter,a liberator,and a humble son of the soil to score cheap political points and want to use all available platforms including funerals of the departed to climb to power.All they know to do is continuously tarnish the image of our country under the pretence that they are holier than everybody and it's only them that have good and genuine morals as they have been portrayed by their invisible masters that once again are fed up with these parasites for not delivering Jacob Zuma's head to them as is the mandate of their masters and handlers.Fellow countrymen let me put it to you that these new puppets have found a playing and climbing pad in our president as any tom dick and Harry can now speak all nonsense as they please about our president as it happened in the funeral of the struggle stalwart Ahmed Mohamed Kathrada which I find to have been too low and factional of them as one would have expected them to preach the theme unity in action as it's the year of Oliver Tambo as per ANC decision,clearly they don't respect the branches of the ANC and its leadership by such actions and as such they should be punished by the ANC.They are hellbent in bringing back deadwood to our organization and go to an extent of defending such rejects,they do this at the expense of building and strengthening the ANC which is what should be their contribution to the ANC as former leaders or elders.The call made by cde Kgalema Motlante for president Jacob Zuma to step down is really a call from a desperate man.A man who failed to unite the ANC as Secretary and also failed to perform as head of state but instead opted to sell one of governments shareholding in one of the country's biggest cellular network companies, the man KM was given a task by the national conference of the ANC to head the political education department and he has done nothing but further devide the ANC through his ambitions to come back and contest during the ANC elective conference in December,this is a man who is the architect of the demise of PETRO SA and many more institutions they are having personal interests in.All this countrymen stems from the fact and truth that their boy Pravin Gordhan is romoured to be on his way out as he is defending white monopoly capital through state institutions such as PIC,GEPF and many more thus stalling service delivery to the poor of this country giving reasons that the economy will collapse which we all know by now that all this is a lie that they deliberately created through the collusive relationship the banks had and continue to enjoy with PG as the biggest defender hence if he goes all their empire will crumble.Let me say to all of them using a dog to chase an eagle isn't advisable so they must engage branches of the ANC honestly not using money as they are doing country wide,we shall defeat your agenda and expose all of you to the public for what you really stand for and what you want to do to our country with the west who are supporting you at all costs.You may remotely control state financial institutions as is happening in PIC with help from certain officials in the ANC,but you will not fool the branches of the ANC and the people of this country their blood and sweat will not go down easily.And as for the ANC all members shouldn't be used for individuals personal interests as some have deemed it their right to enrich themselves using their positions which branches decide upon this should be done away with at all levels of our organization and Alliance.So comrades must cease to want to be good in public when they themselves are the most dirtiest and corrupt individuals,but comrades should work towards unifying the ANC and those that left the ANC should come back correctly through joining a branch and serving in that branch as per constitutional requisite of the ANC and not think they will be parachuted to positions because of their angriest tendencies thus thinking they are inflicting fear amongst members of the ANC it shall never happen.May Ahmed Kathrada soul Rest In Peace he fought a good fight.Edward Muziwoxolo ZumaANC member
