A tranche of leaked e-mails dating back to 2012 reveals who was invited to visit them at their Saxonwold mansion and exactly when these visits occurred. They paint a picture of a family that wined and dined politicians in what is being widely taken as a bid to capture lucrative state business deals.Many of the visitors have either denied impropriety, refused to comment or called their visits their own private business.The Times can reveal that among the guests was President Jacob Zuma's former private secretary, Delsey Sithole.The leaked e-mails show that she forwarded a guest list for a Jacob Zuma Foundation dinner to her own Gmail account and to the CE of Gupta-owned company Sahara, Ashu Chawla, in October 2012. She sent her son's CV to Tony Gupta, asking him to give him an internship in his company.Yesterday she confirmed that she had sent the CV.''I was no longer private secretary to the president in 2013. This was a request in good faith to a contact. It was not linked to any favours or expectations on his side."The calendar appointments, which cement the veracity of the e-mails - which the Hawks are investigating - include mentions of visits to the Gupta mansion by the likes of former government spokesman Jimmy Manyi.

His spokesmam, Zimasa Mbewu, said Thabethe was out of the country.Elzabe Rockman, who was appointed Free State treasury MEC in March 2013, is also mentioned. Her spokesman referred The Times to this statement:"The Free State premier has noted the so-called e-mail communications circulating. The relevant authorities, including the Hawks, have embarked on investigations intended to test the validity and authenticity of such e-mails."Until such investigations are concluded, the premier and the Free State provincial government shall not respond to enquiries."Other visitors included Jacinto Rocha who, when deputy director-general of mining and mineral resources, in 2011, approved an application for iron ore prospecting rights involving reserves with an estimated value of R7-billion by Imperial Crown Trading.Those who have interests in the company are reputed Gupta ally Jagdish Parekh, President Jacob Zuma's son, Duduzane, and former president Kgalema Motlanthe's partner, Gugu Mtshali.Rocha, when approached for comment, said he had resigned from the mining ministry in February 2011 and at the time of visiting the Gupta family was a consultant in the mining industry.Government ministers who have been shown to have had appointments with the Guptas include former communications minister Dina Pule, who visited the Guptas with Magashule in October 2012.
