The price tag was 41% less than the R17 million the property was originally advertised for and approximately R4 million less than an offer made on the house by another prospective buyer according to a report on News24 quoting an estate agent.The seller was his friend and former Public Investment Corporation (PIC) colleague Tshepo Mahloele and the deal was made in January last year the report said.Molefe was sworn in as an MP on Thursday last week amid widespread speculation that he is to be appointed as a member of President Jacob Zuma s Cabinet.He resigned as chief executive of Eskom late in 2016 after being mentioned by former public protector Thuli Madonsela in her State of Capture report which indicated that his relationship with the Gupta family warranted further investigation because of concerns over coal contracts.
