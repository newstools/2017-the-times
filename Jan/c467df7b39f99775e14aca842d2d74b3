Kgetjepe made the announcement on Thursday morning in the presence of pupils and dignitaries.During his address Kgetjepe congratulated Vhembe for its outstanding performance while pointing out that the Vhuronga 1 circuit came out in first place with 81.2% despite being affected by the Vuwani protests. The Edison Nesengani Secondary School which falls under the Vhuronga 1 circuit was amongst the schools that obtained a 100% pass rate. We were saddened to witness teaching and learning in 73 of our primary and secondary schools in Vhembe brought to a halt as a result of the Vuwani protests. Today however is a real testimony that our learners have courageously battled all these wars and managed to sit for their exams like other learners in the province Kgetjepe said.
