Over the past in couple of months there has been a lot of speculation around Laffor s future with possible overseas move speculated on. However Sundowns have laid that to rest after adding a further two years to the Liberian s deal. The 31-year-old international said he was delighted to be staying with the Tshwane giants and hoped to go back to the Club World Cup. When I went back home to Liberia I took my Champions League winning jersey to the President of the country and I want to continue doing so in future he told Downs official website. I have a better opportunity here at Sundowns to play against the best in the continent and the world hence I chose Sundowns. Laffor was instrumental in Downs Caf Champions League final triumph scoring a goal against Zamalek of Egypt in a convincing 3-0 first-leg triumph in Atteridgeville in October. I m eternally grateful to the club president [Patrice Motsepe] coaches and the supporters for the support and love he said.
