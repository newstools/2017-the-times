The Lions did not play against any Australian sides in last year's Super Rugby campaign and Ferreira will be well aware that even in their worst seasons the Waratahs have always found a way to beat the hosts.The Lions class of 2017 will be a difficult one for the Waratahs to topple at Ellis Park but Ferreira said they will not underestimate the 2014 champions.While the Lions have only beaten the Waratahs twice in their history Johan Ackermann's side was on the right side of history (27-22) in their previous encounter two years ago. The Waratahs are just another side and we just play what's in front of us whether they're an Australian or a New Zealand side " Ferreira said."Even if it's a South African side we need to focus on what we need to do and take things week by week."We have to run our own race and we can't worry too much about the Waratahs. The Waratahs have changed a bit in their team set-up and but they've still got threats all around the park."There's the inside centre (Irae Simone) who was playing rugby league and they've got Israel Folau at number 13."There are a lot of Wallabies in that team and we need to do what we need to best. Talking of internationals Ackermann saw fit to drop two of his Springboks in Faf de Klerk and Malcolm Marx to the bench opening the way for Ross Cronje and Robbie Coetzee to get their first starts of the season.Harold Vorster slots at 13 where he replaces the injured Howard Mnisi.Lionel Mapoe is persisted with on the wing.Lions assistant coach Syws de Bruin said it was a case of keeping the players fresh ahead of a long season.Waratahs coach Daryl Gibson has kept faith in the same match-day 23 that beat the Force in Sydney. We're going to have a long season and Ackers does not want to change nor deviate from anything that he's not used to."Robbie's had a very good off season and it was a case of rotating him. It was a horses for courses selection so that's what we've done De Bruin said.Lions: 15 Andries Coetzee 14 Lionel Mapoe 13 Harold Vorster 12 Rohan Janse van Rensburg 11 Courtnall Skosan 10 Elton Jantjies 9 Ross Cronj 8 Warren Whiteley (captain) 7 Ruan Ackermann 6 Jaco Kriel 5 Franco Mostert 4 Andries Ferreira 3 Ruan Dreyer 2 Robbie Coetzee 1 Jacques van Rooyen.
