The international Square Kilometre Array, which is co-located in Africa and Australia and will see the building of the world's largest radio telescope, and Carnarvon High School have become partners in their quest to further mathematics and science education among youngsters.Because the SKA could disrupt the community near Carnarvon, those behind the telescope have looked for ways to give back, deciding to focus on the school.A decade ago the school did not have permanent science and maths teachers. Now, with the help of SKA, it has two.The results have been significant, with nine pupils qualifying for university in the past two years.Their tertiary expenses were covered by SKA.School principal Hendrik Robyn hopes at least four more of his pupils will qualify for university from the school's current matric class.Earlier this year the SKA expanded its assistance to the town's primary school, which recruited a maths and English teacher.In 2009 SKA helped introduce a cyber lab at the school, with 40 computers connected to the SKA's fibre network.Kim de Boer, the SKA's human capital development programme head, said the school had "probably the fastest access in the country at the moment".Robyn said although in the past pupils didn't go into the science field, instead studying education or business, now pupils could study computer science or physics.One of the school's pupils is now studying medicine."The exposure is important for the pupils," he said.
