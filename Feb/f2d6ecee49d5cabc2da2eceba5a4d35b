Nzimande, generally not the most moderate voice on the South African stage, on Sunday delivered what could be one of the most prescient critiques of the ruling party in recent months - more so because it came not only from a cabinet minister but from a leader in the shaky tripartite alliance.The higher education minister denounced the factionalism in the ruling party and what he labelled its increasing disdain for democratic structures. No real surprises there, but he went much further.He attacked head-on President Jacob Zuma and his allies' sudden embrace of "radical economic transformation", describing it as "rhetorical", self-serving and "random", and took a swipe at key Zuma allies in cabinet.He called out this new radicalism for what it is: cynical populism by Team Zuma to regain lost ground both within and outside the party.Nzimande's comments were even more significant against weekend news reports that predicted a massive schism in the ANC's top ranks should Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan be axed.City Press suggested cabinet ministers would resign en masse, led by Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, and would drive a motion of no confidence against Zuma in parliament.The SACP's Jeremy Cronin appeared to confirm this thinking, saying it was possible the SACP's cabinet representatives would walk. Should such a seismic shift occur it would permanently reshape the ANC, but would it result in Zuma's fall?It's hard to say. This may well be the split the Zuma faction secretly hopes for. What easier way to conveniently remove every dissident in a single sweep? Embattled but not broken, some calculated brinkmanship by the Zuma faction is not impossible.
