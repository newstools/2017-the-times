But if the civic movement had its way Ramaphosa would serve alongside his fellow presidential rival Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma to mend internal divisions within the party insiders said on Monday.Sanco in the province officially endorsed him during its provincial executive committee meeting on Saturday.However the civic organisation was quick to play it safe saying while structures have spoken their decision was still to be ratified by its national executive committee this coming weekend.Sanco is part of the ANC SACP and Cosatu alliance currently beset by conspicuous divisions.Senior Sanco members said on Monday that the body had unanimously endorsed Ramaphosa as a matter of principle. While we are aware that the ANC as the leader of the alliance has not pronounced or opened the succession debate it does not stop our members from saying who their preferred candidate is. It does not mean Comrade Nkosazana then becomes a political skunk said a senior leader. But it means if we have our way she should also be included in the top six of the ANC in December considering her seniority experience political astuteness and because she is a woman. You need a healthy party going to 2019 he said.While confirming that his PEC had met KwaZulu-Natal Sanco secretary Richard Mkhungo on Monday sought to play down his party s position on the presidential aspirant and only said that no concrete position was taken. Yes we met but we didn t pronounce on our position but instead decided to take the matter to the NEC this week he said.Pressed further Mkhungo conceded that the membership leaned towards a Ramaphosa candidacy but said this was not an official position until ratified by the national structure.However he declined to comment further.Sanco s eMalahleni region in Newcastle recently incurred the wrath of the ANC PEC when it yanked Ramaphosa from a KwaZulu-Natal ANC-sanctioned election campaign in Nquthu north of the province, to deliver a Chris Hani Memorial Lecture.ANC spokesman Mdumiseni Ntuli had described the lecture as a factional gathering as it included the likes of former premier and ANC chair Senzo Mchunu and erstwhile ANC treasurer and MEC Mike Mabuyakhulu. Mkhungo had fiercely defended his region s actions saying Sanco would call upon any leader to address it whether it was Ramaphosa or Dlamini-Zuma.TMG Digital/TImesLIVE
