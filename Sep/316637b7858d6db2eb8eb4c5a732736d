Siv Ngesi has become infamous for stripping down during his travels across the world. So when he recently visited Victoria Falls in Zambia - it was only a matter of time until we got a picture of him doing his signature pose. This time Siv decided to keep things a little PG and shared a snap of him in his underwear. He also bungee jumped off the falls in the teeny-tiny piece of clothing.
