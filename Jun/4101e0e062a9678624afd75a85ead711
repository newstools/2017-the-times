Chiefs disappointing 2016/17 campaign made it two successive seasons without a trophy for the country s cup kings.At the heart of that disappointment has been the club s signing policy and it has come under scrutiny.Chiefs boss Kaizer Motaung even admitted that Amakhosi erred in some of the signings they made.It wasn t surprising then when two of the seven players who were released on Tuesday were signed at the start of this season.Lewis Macha and the club s Most-Improved Player Mitchel Katsvairo were offloaded.Macha s contract was terminated by mutual consent along with that of Siyanda Xulu Lucky Baloyi and Camaldine Abraw.Katsvairo will be sent out on loan before he is assessed again at the end of next season before a permanent decision on his future with Amakhosi is made. Enocent Mkhabela who was on loan at Platinum Stars has been given an opportunity to make his stay permanent with Dikwena.Siphelele Mthembu s contract has been terminated. These players have contracts with the club but they did not enjoy sufficient game-time during last season and we felt it would be in their best interests as well as ours for them to pursue their careers elsewhere Chiefs football manager Bobby Motaung said. We have decided to revamp the squad early so that when we commence pre-season training we prepare ourselves adequately for the tough season ahead."We owe it to our supporters to ensure that the events of the past two seasons are not repeated in the 2017/18 campaign. This is the second successive season that Chiefs have made a major squad overhaul.Last season Chiefs released 20 players.But Xulu Edward Manqele and Mthembu ended up returning to the club as there was no club interested in them. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
