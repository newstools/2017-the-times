Phahlane was addressing Parliament's police portfolio committee where he and Minister Nathi Nhleko updated MPs about the string of accusations around him including how he was able to build an R8 million home and that he had received an R80 000 sound system.He said the constant scrutiny around him since 2009 was "tiring" but that he remains "unshaken" by allegations of wrongdoing.Phahlane said he believed that he was being targeted by private investigator Paul O Sullivan who together with the Independent Police Complaints Directorate showed up at his home asking questions that he did not believe had to do with O Sullivan's claims of corruption."He was asking the security questions that have nothing to do with corruption like how many protectors do I have and whether they live in my house or outside and the times of my movements. And then when he asked for the plans of my house I thought how can they land up in this person's hands."Phlahlane told the committee that he had a R3 million bond with a bank and had the receipts to prove that the sound system which he said was an entire entertainment system including televisions in his new home had been paid for.Asked by DA MP Zak Mbhele whether he would be willing to undergo a lifestyle audit he said: "I am on record as saying on the level I am at (in the SAPS) that's what we subscribe to. To be given top secret clearance I had to go through that " he said adding that he had no problem doing it again."But will people who are private investigators do the same?" he said in a dig at O Sullivan.He said claims that he had received a vehicle as a gift were also wrong."We have a policy that we must declare gifts but I was not given a gift. That vehicle does not belong to me it belongs to the dealership who sponsored it and will be returned to them after 18 months " he said.The committee also heard a detailed breakdown of all the concerns raised in a forensic report dating back to when Phahlane was a divisional head of the forensics unit by Brigadier Linda Kleynhans. Mbhele has previously said that IPID should investigate Phahlane's entire career. Phahlane told the committee that he was open to that as he had a good record with the SAPS.Kleynhans detailed the findings of a forensic report ordered by then police commissioner Riah Phiyega after complaints by police union Popcru.Among the complaints were some tender irregularities evidence backlogs and claims that Phahlane had sexual relationships with female colleagues who received promotions or special treatment. Kleynhans was named as one of them.Phahlane was cleared of the claims as no evidence to support the relationships was discovered.Nhleko meanwhile backed Phahlane saying that if the report had made findings against Phahlane he "would not have hesitated" to take disciplinary action.Phahlane joked with the committee that some of the claims included that he had fathered a child with Kleynhans and hidden the baby in the Western Cape."While we are here we will go visit the baby and people are welcome to photograph us visiting our coloured baby " he joked.The committee also received the Claassen report into Phiyega's fitness to hold office.TMG Digital/TimesLIVE
