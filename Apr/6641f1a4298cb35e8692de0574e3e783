We responded peacefully he said.Haywood said the group also broke a tent.Masango says despite the threats and intimidation, they will not be deterred. #SaveSA #PeoplesMarch pic.twitter.com/62ihNp9l4B What I want to say about this is that we have photographs of these people. One is an ANC councillor we are told. One is an ANCYL leader in the Pretoria area. We will report it to the police. We will lay charges against these people and we won t be intimidated. This is our democratic right. - TMG Digital
