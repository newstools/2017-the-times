Speaking in Pongola to about 2,000 people on Saturday, NFP leader Zanele KaMagwaza-Msibi said: "I was very hurt when we could not contest last year's local government elections. But one thing became crystal clear for me - the need to start afresh."It is in this spirit that I have taken a conscious decision to suspend everything so that we can focus mainly on inaugurating branches."This meant that no regional, provincial or national conferences would be held, she said."We put everything else on hold and focus purely on putting our structures in place."If it means this will take us the entire year, so be it," KaMagwaza-Msibi said.
