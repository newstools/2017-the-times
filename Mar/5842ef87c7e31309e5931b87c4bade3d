The Nyan'Nyan host is putting the finishing touches to an upcoming documentary about his life and took to Instagram this week to give fans a sneak peek of a scene he shot with Zola.Luyanda paid tribute to Zola by sharing a picture of the veteran "praying and blessing" him. The TV personality said that the musician was a big brother to him and a witness to his "hard life in Johannesburg"."We (celebs) don't make as much money as our fame. I know that some of us fake a lot, pretending as if we've made it and we're living it up, but I'm afraid that's very rare for most 'celebrities' in South Africa, especially when you're off season. Because 'off season' means 'off income'."Zola knew this. That's why he would always donate some money to me to keep my head above water, (even) when I was already a famous TV host. I apologize if this post will offend some people and some 'celebrities.' I tell it as it is and its high time we recognize and thank people while they're still alive," he wrote.He also lambasted the SA TV industry, saying that it should "really takes care of its talent".Zola was one of those rumoured to have fallen on hard times but Luyanda said that nothing could be further from the truth."When the media was reporting to you that Zola had fallen on hard times (which obviously was orchestrated lies). He was in fact laughing with us, at his house, at the false reports - because he's always been working on his businesses and producing."You can't say a guy has hit hard times when he was continuing helping people, including Luyanda Potwana, that he would give huge sums of money to go buy groceries and send some home," Luyanda said.
