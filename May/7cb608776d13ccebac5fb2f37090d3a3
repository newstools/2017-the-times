The trucks apparently burst into flames on impact. One man had died after sustaining serious burns in the collision. The fire department is battling the blaze and will determine if anyone else was in the trucks after the fire is extinguished. The road is totally closed to traffic. We ask people to be patient until officials have time to open this road said Netcare911 spokesman Chris Botha.
