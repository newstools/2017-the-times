Taking to social media on Wednesday evening, Cassper said that he had been inundated with requests to address iFani, after the rapper threw massive shade at him in a string of tweets earlier this week. "There's a lot going on and they want me to say something," he wrote.He went on to add that he was a rapper not a "tweleb" and he would prefer to let his music do the talking."I'm a musician, I make music. I'm not a tweleb. If I have something to say, it'll be on my album," he added.Fans were excited at the thought of Cassper throwing verbal punches at iFani through his music and urged him to "murder iFani" lyrically.Cassper had earlier in the day posted a video of himself saying that he was pushing "positive vibes", which many saw as an early response to iFani's jab.
