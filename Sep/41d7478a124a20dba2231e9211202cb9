Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga said on Tuesday his coalition would not participate in a re-run of a presidential election proposed for Oct. 17 unless they are given "legal and constitutional" guarantees. "You cannot do a mistake twice and expect to get different results," Odinga told reporters. Kenya's Supreme Court on Friday ordered a re-run of the Aug. 8 vote within 60 days, saying President Uhuru Kenyatta's victory was undermined by irregularities in the process.
