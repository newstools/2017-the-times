Pearl, who is currently based in the US while filming for TV show Quantico, lashed out at recent report involving her love life.Sunday Sun reported that Pearl's father, Bhekizizwe Thusi has been left "fuming" with the Marawas who are allegedly yet to pay lobola for her.The paper quotes Bhekizizwe as saying, "the Marawa family treats Pearl as their makoti. But they haven t united the two families in the traditional way. And I m still waiting for the Marawas to come for ilobolo negotiations."The article went on to claim that Bhekizizwe felt that the Marawas were allegedly "undermining him" as Pearl's father.However, Pearl has some strong words about the alleged fiasco."South African tabloids and how they'll stop at nothing to destroy you. No matter what you do to make your people proud. No less than impimpi during the struggle. We had warriors of the struggle fighting for redemption but no- they must destroy for a salary," Pearl said.The actress went on to blast the "mud-slinging".And so as 2017 begins with my own slinging mud at me &amp; mine. The storm is officially here. This is how 2016 started. And we finished strong.There is a bigger picture. Don't be distracted.Pearl added she will not be deterred by the reports.Here's to the ones who thought they'd write books &amp; change the world but ended up at the desk writing about other people every week. Some people create a personal hell and want to drag everyone else in it.
