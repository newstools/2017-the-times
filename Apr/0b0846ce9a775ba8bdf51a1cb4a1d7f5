I m here just to see all my colleagues from Cosafa. As you know we started this change for Cosafa from Sun City Ahmad said. And from there we prepared to take this power in the African confederation to bring it to the South. Now we have reached this target and it s logic to come back here to thank my colleagues and to discuss with them how to manage Caf now. Of course I have a programme. But the manifesto is not enough. And I m here to assure my colleagues that I am president of Caf but I am a Cosafa member first. And I trust them to help me with this challenge.
