Many pupils could not understand the verbs in their matric exam questions, leading to poor answers, and the majority struggled with critical thinking.The National Senior Certificate diagnostic report for last year's matric exams was released yesterday, giving a devastating insight into the poor quality of answers.The report examined the answers to 11 of the most popular subjects and offered tips to help teachers improve their matric teaching.Subjects analysed included maths literacy, second-language English, geography and economics.The report noted an improvement in answers in the history and accounting exams.It said answers at some schools had improved since 2015.But in the summary it said matrics could not read well enough to understand questions, struggled to think abstractly or creatively or did not have sufficient knowledge of the subject from Grade 10 or 11. Examples of difficulties experienced and recorded in the report included:In the English second-language exam:In the history exam:In the maths literacy exam:In the economics exam:In the English literature paper based on the year's setwork books:The summary said language weakness remained a difficulty for many matrics, affecting their ability to "interpret questions and source material for answers", and to frame "appropriate responses".Most matrics found it "impossible" to answer what the department called "higher-order thinking" questions, requiring logic, reasoning or evaluation.Pupils were unable to cope when the question required independent or creative thought, it said.
