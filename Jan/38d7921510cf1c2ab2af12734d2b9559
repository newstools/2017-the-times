In making the announcement on Friday Free State Stars General manager Rantsi Mokoena said he was delighted to have added Mtshweni Thabang Matuka Mohammed Anas Nhlakanipho Ntuli and Allen Dorian Nono to their stable. We have made use of the window period and the Africa Cup of Nations break to make sure that we assess and sign the five quality players to strengthen the team said Mokoena. The team is ready to compete in the second round of the season."We were struggling to find the back of the net and we have brought in two quality strikers to help out Thokozani Sekotlong whose injury is coming well and should be ready in no time."We also struggled a bit on the left hand side but we have also brought in two experience players to compete in that department. With the additions Stars coach Serame Letsoaka has been reunited with one of his former players from Bloemfontein Celtic in the form of Matuka who together Mtsweni joined on free transfers.Two strikers Anas and Nono have also been roped in with Mokoena citing their lack of goals in the first-half of the campaign as their main concern to rectify.The youth international playmaker Nhlakanipho Ntuli who is considered the marquee signing joins his first professional club in South Africa since leaving Eredivisie side FC Twente.Stars also announced that they have released Reabetsoe Rakoti Tshepo Mothiba David Booysen Johnny Mathole Brandon Dean Hamis Kizza and Mohamed Aoudou by mutual consent. As Free State Stars we would like to wish the players that have left the team the best of luck in their future endeavors and we warmly welcome the new guys he said. - TMG Digital
