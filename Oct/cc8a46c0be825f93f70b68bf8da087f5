Alleged underworld boss Jerome Booysen was taken to hospital after he was wounded in a shooting at Cape Town International Airport on Wednesday morning. TimesLIVE has established that the businessman was “not seriously wounded”. He was taken to hospital by his bodyguard. A pool of blood was left in the area where the shooting happened‚ which was cordoned off. It is the third time this year Booysen‚ said to be the leader of the Sexy Boys gang‚ has been shot at. Robbie Roberts‚ director of law enforcement in the City of Cape Town‚ said: “Two vehicles involved at the drop-off point. One person wounded. SAPS will be investigating.” Roberts said the perpetrators fled the scene and were still at large.
