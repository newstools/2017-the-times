So when she rocked up on the red carpet at the recent Naledi Awards with her children, everyone was swooning. While mom looking dazzling as always, her little girl and boy stole the show. Kgomotso's little man was dressed in a full black tux and her daughter wore the most adorable pink frock with a fur coat. Her daughter, who is definitely following in her mom's footsteps was nominated in the Best Children's Production Category. How cute?
