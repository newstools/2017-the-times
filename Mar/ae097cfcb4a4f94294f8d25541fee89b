ANCYL provincial spokesman Siyabulela Tom appeared in court yesterday for allegedly calling a police officer a "p**s" and assaulting another at a roadblock in Sea Point.Tom is facing three charges of assault and crimen injuria after his arrest last year. He pleaded not guilty.He has, instead, launched a counterclaim against the police. Tom alleged that an officer called him a bobbejaan (baboon) before he was taken into custody.Tom has also lodged a complaint of racism against the officer with the SA Human Rights Commission.However, City of Cape Town senior traffic officer Jeremy Minnie told the court that Tom appeared intoxicated on the day and swore at members of his team. Tom later slapped him on the chest, he said.Minnie said Tom also stood in road, blocking traffic, and boasted that he was an ANC member and "we will see what will happen to us".The traffic officer said Tom was in the passenger's seat when the driver of the vehicle was arrested. The driver refused to blow into a breathalyser.Minnie alleged that Tom got out of the car and later shouted at the officers, accusing an SAPS officer of calling him a bobbejaan."[He told me]: 'F*** you, you coloured and white people think that you are in charge. You p**s!' " said Minnie.He said Tom shouted at another SAPS officer, daring him to take out his gun and shoot because "that's what you guys are good for".However Nicholas Madolo SC, representing Tom, told the court that his client only approached police when an officer asked him to translate for his driver.He said this was because the driver could not understand Minnie's instructions.However, said Madolo, when Tom did as he was told he was instructed to move away and called a "baboon" by the SAPS officer.
