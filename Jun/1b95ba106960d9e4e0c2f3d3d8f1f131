The disgraced megastar faces three counts of aggravated, indecent assault, which each carry a maximum sentence of 10 years in jail and a $25,000 fine.Up to 60 women have publicly accused Cosby of being a serial sexual predator for decades, ending his career and leaving him isolated from friends and celebrities.But his fate rests on the allegations of just one, Andrea Constand, about an encounter at his Philadelphia mansion in January 2004. It is the only criminal case against him as most of the alleged abuse happened too long ago to prosecute."I wanted it to stop," 44-year-old Constand said on the second day of the trial about the evening in question. Her testimony is central to the case against the 79-year-old star of The Cosby Show, which legal experts say will essentially boil down to her word against his.She says the comedian, whom she considered a mentor, gave her three pills and wine before sexually assaulting her on his couch after she sought his advice.The then 30-year-old had asked Cosby if the pills were herbal and he indicated they were. "I said I trust you," she recalled saying at the time. About half an hour latershe had trouble talking and difficulty moving and was suffering double vision. After briefly losing consciousness, she regained it as Cosby was touching her private parts, she testified."In my head I was trying to get my hands to move, get my legs to move, but I was frozen and those messages didn't get there," she said, her voice breaking.
