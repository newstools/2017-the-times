A group of pastors and traditional leaders want the Hibiscus Coast Municipality to reverse its decision allowing beach-goers to go naked at the Mpenjanti beach.Led by Reverend Mike Effanga the pastors argue the beach will have a bad influence on young people.Now nude beach-goers are awaiting Busisiwe Mkhwebane's report to learn if parts of Mpenjanti will remain nudist.She stopped them from flaunting their nudity in December pending her final report. We were approached by pastors that call themselves the Concerned Citizens Group Mkhwebane told reporters at a briefing in Pretoria. They complained that the Hibiscus Coast Municipality approved an application by an association of nudists to use parts of the Mpenjanti beach to enjoy their nudity. The 250m strip of coastline is believed to been an unofficial nudist beach for about 30 years. The Hibiscus Coast Municipality granted it the nude beach status in 2014 arguing it would bolster tourism in the area. The municipality appears to believe there will be economic spin-offs for the area if this is allowed to go ahead said Mkhwebane. The pastors on the other hand are worried that kids will be exposed to nudity; that there will be promiscuity; and possibly prostitution. Then there are traditional leaders who are of the view that the place is a sacred place. Mkhwebane said her deputy Kevin Malunga is handling the matter.TMG Digital/Sowetan
