The Right2Know Campaign (R2K) issued a statement Friday encouraging people to engage critically with the news of the extraordinary plan. We urge South Africans to ensure these events are not used cynically to justify greater power for the security services the statement read. We cannot ignore the possibility for state institutions to seize these events as an opportunity to create an artificial security crisis R2K warned. It is common in any situation for securocrats to generate a crisis to justify more power and influence and a closing down of democratic space. The track record of the Hawks does not inspire confidence. On Wednesday the Hawks arrested Elvis Ramasedbudi after intercepting communications related to possible assassinations tied to targets Ramasedbudi allegedly perceived as state capture beneficiaries.R2K s statement posits two main issues they say should be viewed carefully. The first is the names of the two structures Ramasedbudi has been linked two: the Anti-State Capture Death Squad Alliance and the Anti-White Monopoly Capitalists Regime . It is not credible that genuine covert structures would be so descriptively named. The second point was that a credible coup attempt was highly unlikely to involve open efforts at fundraising .Ramasedbudi appearing in public for the first time Friday morning after a brief meeting in Johannesburg Magistrate s Court faces a provisional charge of conspiracy to commit murder. The state also recommended he should undergo mental evaluation.
