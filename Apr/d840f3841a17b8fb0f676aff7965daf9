Organizer Pupa Fumba said the group was not politically driven but instead made up of community groups looking for positive change within the government."What we voted for in 1994 was transparency freedom of expression and the right to be heard but now we have a government that undermines all that. It's now about the elites driving their own agenda."We aren't part of any party looking to impose their platform we are from all levels of the community coming together " Fumba said.The group plans to camp outside of parliament until the joint session of parliament takes place on the 18th.- TMG Digital/TimesLIVE
