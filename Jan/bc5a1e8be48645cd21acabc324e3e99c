Here is our list of players who failed to deliver in 2016:1) Felipe Ovono (Orlando Pirates goalkeeper)Things started well for the 23 year-old Equatorial Guinean-born shot-stopper at the start of the season at Orlando Pirates but two disastrous performances in quick succession relegated him to the stands.He was the main culprit in the Bucs 2-1 MTN8 quarterfinal defeat to Bidvest Wits at Bidvest Stadium in August where he shockingly spilled the ball on numerous occasions and was punished by the Clever Boys.2) Masibusane Zongo (Platinum Stars)Platinum Stars parted ways with the gifted but troubled winger Zongo in May after he failed to make the most of a lifeline thrown to him by the club.Stars coach Cavin Johnson had offered the serial offender still only 26 years old an opportunity to resurrect a career dogged by truancy wayward behaviour and controversy.Even Jabu Mahlangu who was the poster boy of bad boy behaviour once upon a time and faced similar demons during his playing days was stunned when Zongo appeared before the club s disciplinary committee and was dismissed after missing training from April 9 to 19.A disappointed Mahlangu told Times Media Digital at the time it was clear that his pleas to Zongo had fallen on deaf ears.Mahlangu had tried to talk some sense into the serial truant but Zongo seemingly never listened.Zongo was later handed another chance to revive his career at Royal Eagles with a two year-deal but predictably he also spurned that opportunity and he returned to his wayward ways.3) Thandani Ntshumayelo (Former Orlando Pirates midfielder)Orlando Pirates terminated Ntshumayelo s contract after he tested positive for cocaine after a urine sample was taken in a random drugs test after a Pirates match against Platinum Stars at Orlando Stadium on January 9.He pleaded guilty in an SA Institute for Drug-Free Sport hearing in August and was banned for four years.Ntshumayelo claimed he took the drug while partying with friends earlier this year. Really a 26-year-old claiming peer pressure as his defence? Unbelievable!Eyebrows were raised when the player and his legal representatives then missed a 21-day deadline to appeal the four-year ban saying they will go the court route to overturn the sentence.Ay caramba what a waste of talent.4) Phumelele Bhengu (Former SuperSport United)Bhengu plundered 22 goals in the National First Division for Thanda Royal Zulu in the 2014-2015 season that prompted a move to SuperSport United.But just four substitute appearances the last in August last year has been a dismal return.In a somewhat disappointing confirmation of the striker's failure to transfer his convincing National First Division form a step up to PSL level he has returned to the lower tier and joined Royal Eagles.5) Edward Manqele (Kaizer Chiefs)Manqele was initially amongst the players that were deemed to be surplus to requirements at Kaizer Chiefs during the mass exodus that shook Naturena in June.The 29-year-old striker was then handed a lifeline by the Soweto giants after impressing the technical team during pre-season.Despite being given a second chance Manqele has done little to convince even the staunchest Chiefs fans that he deserves to be allowed within a kilometre of the club's shirt. - TMG Digital
