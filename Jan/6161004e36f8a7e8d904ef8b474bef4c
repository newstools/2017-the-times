Chairman Ben Ngubane called on industries to "optimise capacity and invest"."This is not a once-off exercise. Eskom has been turned around and will continue to generate surplus electricity," said Ngubane.For this performance he credited the leadership of former CEO Brian Molefe, who resigned at the end of last year after being negatively implicated in the former public protector's State of Capture report."Brian Molefe's legacy will go down as the man who turned Eskom around," Ngubane said.Speaking at the utility's state of the system briefing, Ngubane said that Eskom was powering the rest of the Southern African region with its surplus capacity.Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown, who is responsible for Eskom, said the turnaround would be further aided by the three new power stations under construction.She said electricity demand had been flat for the past 10 years as growth dropped to below 1%.
