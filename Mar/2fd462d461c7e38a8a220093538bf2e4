Searl Derman who heads up the Saving Private Rhino NGO said they received a call from a farmer in the Mpumalanga area who had found the calf suckling from his deceased mother early one morning. She had died during the night from an infection.The young male travelled by road for 17 hours with conservationist Divan Grobler who had spent 10 days stabilizing the baby rhino and gaining his trust before the journey to the private Aquila Private Game Reserve.Grobler has also spent the past 14 months hand-rearing another calf Osita that was found abandoned by his mother on the reserve.The yet-to-be-named baby was welcomed by Searl and Hunter Mitchell the schoolboy who has already raised over R100 000 for the care of Osita.Hunter who turns 10 next week intends to fundraise for the new baby rhino too starting off the donations with his birthday money.Caring for a baby rhino is extremely costly and high risk as they are prone to infections the NGO said.A baby rhino needs a milk feed every three hours and there are a lot of additional staff intensive chores with regard to feeding hygiene and cleaning facilities on a 24-hour basis.Each baby will drink approximately R5 000 of milk a month and when they get a bit older the young rhino will eat an additional R5 000 of lucerne and teff grass a month.The Aquila reserve said last month they would not disclose the exact location of the orphanage for the rescued calves in the interests of their rehabilitation and security.
