Athletic World Champions Luvo Manyonga and Caster Semenya predictably won big at the South African Sports Awards. Manyonga, who has completed a 360 degree turn in his life, won the sportsman of the year award. Manyonga followed up on his 2016 Rio Olympics long jump silver medal with a gold at the London-hosted IAAF World Championships in August. Semenya, who eased to the 800m women's gold medal in last year's Olympiad, added the gold medal in the same event to her burgeoning collection. Semenya also won a bronze in the women's 1500m at the World Championships. Tiso Blackstar Group photographer Simphiwe Nkwali won the photographer of the year award while young 400m hurdles sensation Sokwakhana Zazini took home the newcomer of the year award The Springbok sevens rugby team deservedly collected the Team of the Year award.
