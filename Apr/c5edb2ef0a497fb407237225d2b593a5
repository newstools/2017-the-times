From an organizational point of view and taking into account how previous reshuffles have occurred I have my reservations on the process followed in this cabinet reshuffle.The discomfort around this current reshuffle arises from concerning circumstances of the recall of the Minister of Finance from an important international investment promotion tour the surfacing of an intelligence report which appears to be dubious at the least and as a consequence the negative public image and possible undesirable effects on our country's economy all of which the ANC as the ruling party has to take responsibility for.Unlike previous consultations which take place with senior officials of the ANC during such appointments and changes to the composition of the national executive the briefing by the President left a distinct impression that the ANC is no longer the centre and thus depriving the leadership collective of its responsibly to advise politically on executive matters. Ordinarily this is how leadership takes collective responsibility for decisions made.This is no way meant to undermine the prerogative of the President of the Republic in reshuffling or making changes to his cabinet which is derived from the Constitution of the South Africa. However it is to ensure that such decisions made can be owned justified and defended by the leadership collective in the interest of the ANC and the people of South Africa.The capability of each of the newly-appointed cadres and introduction of younger leaders to the national executive is acknowledged and we wish them well in their new responsibilities.Ultimately both serving and these newly appointed cadres have the responsibility of implementing the ANC mandate to pursue radical socio-economic transformation.While there are many outstanding cabinet ministers with regards to integrity and performance we need to admit that there are also several serving ministers whose performance is unsatisfactory hence they have attracted severe criticism as public representatives against whom appropriate action would be expected. The ANC leadership can therefore not justify to be seen to have ignored or not considered these glaring factors in a cabinet reshuffle.A need arises for the leadership of the ANC as the ruling party that contested won the elections and deployed its members to government to seriously apply its mind and express a collective view to these developments.
