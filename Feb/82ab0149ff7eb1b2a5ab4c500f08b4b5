Thomas Thabane, leader of the All Basotho Convention party, was greeted by thousands of supporters at a rally in the capital, Maseru, as political instability threatens to again shake the country."Prime Minister [Pakalitha] Mosisili must open parliament ... so that we can legally overthrow his government and take over," Thabane said."It is clear that he no longer has enough parliamentary seats to govern this country."Lesotho has been hit by power struggles since a failed coup in June 2014, which led to elections in early 2015 when Thabane narrowly lost power.Mosisili, of the Democratic Congress party, currently heads a fragmented coalition government that took power after the elections.Thabane, who said he fled after being tipped off about a plot to kill him, told News24: "I am taking a huge risk by going back to Lesotho. The threat on my life is still there."In 2014 army chief Tlali Kamoli was accused of launching a coup against Thabane when soldiers attacked police headquarters, looted weapons and killed one officer.A senior general, who was seen as close to Thabane, was gunned down in June 2015 by soldiers.Thabane, who was based in South Africa during his self-imposed exile, used his speech on Sunday to criticise the Southern African Development Community for lack of support.Lesotho is one of the world's poorest countries and its economy is heavily dependent on South Africa, to which it exports water and hydroelectric power.Two other opposition leaders also returned with Thabane on Sunday.The three opposition parties are pushing for a no-confidence motion against Mosisili's government when parliament reopens on February 24.
