A phone called can be made and the door can be unlocked."Meanwhile acting police commissioner Khomotso Phahlane has refused to discuss the details of O Sullivan's arrest.Phahlane appeared on eNCA s The Justice Factor on Monday night and had prepared to discussed police successes. I won t dignify people like Paul O Sullivan by granting them airtime to discuss their issues he said.Phahlane later told Malala that he would not help in making Paul O Sullivan a hero. O'Sullivan has been probing Phahlane along with the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) and Phahlane has previously questioned his involvement in the case.Last week the acting commissioner filed court papers at the High Court in Pretoria demanding O Sullivan's involvement in the investigation be declared unlawful.
