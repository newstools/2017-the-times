In a statement issued to TshisaLIVE Gagasi FM set the record straight on the station's state of affairs.This after Sunday Sun reported that the station was losing three of its top DJs, which had allegedly affected advertising revenue."What is more concerning about some of these reports is the extent to which they have been sensationalised, going as far as alleging that Gagasi FM is in 'turmoil' and quoting faceless sources in an effort to give legs to this baseless narrative," Gagasi FM spokesperson Khulekani Shandu said in a statement.Khulekani said that it was not unusual for other stations to approach presenters."There is nothing extra ordinary if other radio stations approach some of our presenters, it is in the nature of the industry we are in and particularly at this time of the year, it comes natural," Khulekani added.The station labelled suggestions that it was falling apart as shocking."It is therefore shocking that some publications would attempt to create an impression that 'everything is falling apart' on the basis that our presenters are attracting interest elsewhere."
