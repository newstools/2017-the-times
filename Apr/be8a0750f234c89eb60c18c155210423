Blue stole the hearts of South Africans when she participated in Big Brother with her partner K2. However, the star admitted to TshisaLIVE that she's been trying to shake off that image for some time."A lot of people knew me because of Big Brother. But the problem with that was I was not alone, I was with K2. When I left the house suddenly mine and K2's brands were inseperable. There was a lot of work to try and convince people that I could be my own brand," Blue said.Since leaving the house Blue has scored several major projects and endorsements. She also plans to release a denim fashion range later this year."I am proud of myself because I feel like I am not just going to remembered as Blue from Big Brother, because the truth is, I don't see myself as a reality star anymore," Blue admitted.Even though we might not see her on reality TV, she revealed that she might soon be on the big screen."I have been offered roles in films but I really want to find the roles that are best for me and my career. Being in movies is something I want to do, it's a dream, I just want to do it right," she added.Being a star can come with its drawbacks, especially in an age when Twitter trolls roam the social media looking for someone to bully. Blue said that she is not phased by the haters because she knows who she is."I am the kind of person who doesn't focus on the hate. To be honest, I am too busy to pay it any attention. I know myself. I know my strengths and weaknesses so there is nothing you can tell me that can shake me," Blue said.
