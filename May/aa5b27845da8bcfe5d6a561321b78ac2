Mokonyane's deputy Pamela Tshwete will also attend the event at Goudini Spa near Worcester.The gathering coincides with a vote by the City of Cape Town to impose level 4 water restrictions banning all use of tap water outside after dam levels fell to 21.2%.Zille s spokesman Michael Mpofu said she would highlight several crucial interventions which required cooperation across all spheres of government. These were:- Maintenance and replacement of bulk infrastructure. It is estimated that R3-billion is needed to address municipal water infrastructure backlogs in the Western Cape;- Extension of the Vo lvlei and Clanwilliam dam walls;- Behaviour change; and- Dual water systems allowing non-potable water to be used for flushing in new developments. Premier Zille will encourage the different spheres of government to co-operate in finding solutions that could not only address the current crisis but mitigate a disaster in the future said Mpofu. A broad range of interventions will be discussed including tapping into the Table Mountain aquifer desalination and water re-use.
