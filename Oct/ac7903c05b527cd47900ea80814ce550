Forget IT and all the other scary movies that promised to terrify you this year. Halloween is just around the corner and The Evil Within 2 has all your spine-tingling chills covered.

What you probably need is a moment to breathe or a device that will remind you to do that, and Inscape may be just what you're looking for.

On Las Culturistas, comedians turned "culture consultants" Matt Rogers and Bowen Yang interview a new comedian each week on their teal couch about culture and life in the way only two bitchy queer boys can. They rip everything apart from the TV series Big Little Lies to all-you-can-eat lobster restaurants, but the podcast is best known for its segment called I Don't Think So, Honey! in which the boys and their guest are allowed to spend one full minute ranting about something that is ticking at their tacks (bothering them) about culture. The results are ridiculous and hilarious.
