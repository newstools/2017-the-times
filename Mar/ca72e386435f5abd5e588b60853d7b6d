While the two leaders clashed over Brexit, which May is set to trigger today, and Sturgeon pushed for another Scottish independence referendum, the Mail spun it as a battle of the legs and focused on what could be read into their outfits and body language."Never mind Brexit, who won Legs-it!," the tabloid's front page said, alongside a picture of the two leaders meeting on Monday."It wasn't quite stilettos at dawn, but there was a distinctly frosty atmosphere," it read underneath.Inside, the paper's style editor compared their "boxy navy blazers, skirts stopped just above the knee, shiny nude tights and pointy shoes - a look replicated by career women of a certain age worldwide".Columnist Sarah Vine asserted: "What stands out here are the legs - and the vast expanse on show. There is no doubt that both women consider their pins to be the finest weapon in their physical arsenal."Former women and equalities minister Nicky Morgan called it "appalling sexism" that Britain's most senior female politicians were being judged for their legs.
