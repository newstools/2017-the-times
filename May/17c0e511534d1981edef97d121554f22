Women were better than men at recognising when a dog was being playful or threatening, or feeling fear, scientists discovered.For the study, 40 volunteers listened to different growls recorded from 18 dogs that were guarding their food, facing a threatening stranger, or playing a tug-of-war game.Overall, participants correctly classified 63% of the growl samples, significantly more than would be expected by guesswork alone, said the researchers.Each growl type was also recognised above chance level. The human listeners identified 81% of the "play" growls but were less good at recognising food guarding and threatening growls.Tamas Farago and his team at Eotvos Lorand University, in Hungary, wrote in the journal Royal Society Open Science: "Participants associated the correct contexts with the growls more often than chance would allow."Moreover, women, and participants experienced with dogs, scored higher."During play, dogs produced a larger number of shorter, less separated, growls than when they were aggressive or fearful, the research showed.Play growls and food guarding growls had distinctively different pitches.
