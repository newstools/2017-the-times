Domingo was particularly incensed that Rossouw had not communicated with him since the end of SA's Test tour of Australia in early December and chose to break his silence when he announced his intention to take up a Kolpak contract. I'm really disappointed with Rilee and I haven't heard from him since we left Australia " a seething Domingo said."Someone has been trying to get hold of him and there was an email response from an iPhone from his father saying his son has taken up a Kolpak contract and he also spelt my name wrong with one L instead of two. I'm bitterly disappointed because he was the next batsman in and he's played in all our structures."He's the guy we backed after five noughts and if it was a player of colour we backed after getting five noughts everybody would have said transformation."He got five noughts but we thought this is the guy who could play at the closest level to AB de Villiers in the limited overs setup. I'm bitterly disappointed. Rossouw's malevolence in terms of announcing his Kolpak contract exit to Domingo left the mentor with a bee in his bonnet.The Knights and Proteas ODI batsman has been persisted with through a forgettable start to his international career and injury.The bad faith in which Rossouw announced his departure did not go down well with Domingo especially after he also had to deal with Kyle Abbott's Kolpak contract-enforced retirement.Cricket South Africa has terminated Abbott's national contract while the same is going to happen to Rossouw's contract.The displeasure in Domingo's voice was evident in the face of the duo's betrayal.Even though he did not want to say much afterwards their apparent dishonesty rubbed him up the wrong way and for the foreseeable future bridges have been permanently burnt. There have been issues that haven't been discussed and issues players have not been honest about."I've picked players and they've known that they're done which sets me and the team back massively because Kyle was going to take the new ball for us in the Champions Trophy."Who'll take the new ball for us 10 matches before the tournament starts?"Players need to understand these things and also be open and honest."If Kyle didn't have an idea of being back then I don't know. I've had discussions with Kyle six to eight months ago encouraging him to hang in and stay within the side while the main bowlers were fit."I thought it had subsided until two days ago and I'm disappointed that all of this has unfolded without us being able to make a sales pitch to him in terms of what we can offer him."Nobody is guaranteed a place in the national team. - TMG Digital
