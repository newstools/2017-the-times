"If there was a tip-off that crime would not have happened. I have not had a briefing from anyone that had information about this crime before it took place " he said.The acting National Police Commissioner was speaking at an impromptu press briefing in Richmond on Wednesday.A gang of at least eight robbers pulled off the daring heist when armed with a marked police van and two high-powered vehicles they drove up to a South African Airways flight wearing police uniforms and attacked guards from GuardForce as the money was about to be loaded onto the aircraft."I want us to allow the investigation to continue. This is a crime that was committed overnight and the police are hard at work on the investigation " Phahlane added."There is an allegation that police were involved and we understand that a marked police vehicle and a second with blue lights were used in the commission of the robbery."Two vehicles have been recovered in Gauteng and on examination the allegation that they are official police vehicles is unsupported. They are bogus police cars " he said. - TMG Digital/The Times
