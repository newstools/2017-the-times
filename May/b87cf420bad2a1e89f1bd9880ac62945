The case was once again adjourned on Friday afternoon to late next week for the reexamination of Safa chief executive Dennis Mumble by his lawyer Mark Thompson.During Friday s hearing Mumble said that an overwhelming majority of Safa s NEC members supported the suspension and subsequent termination of the contract of Mashaba.Mumble said this when he was cross-questioned by Mashaba s lawyer Claudio Bollo before the hearing was adjourned to next week Friday.Mumble said he contacted all the 32 members of the NEC through a circular to inform them of his decision to suspend Mashaba the day after Bafana Bafana s 2-1 win over Senegal in a World Cup qualifier at Peter Mokaba Stadium in December.As a result of the suspension Mashaba was barred from traveling with the team to Mozambique for a friendly match a few days later and he was later fired for damaging the reputation of the association.Mumble reiterated that the relationship between Mashaba and the association has been irreparably damaged because of his public outbursts after the crucial win over Senegal in Polokwane. There was a pattern over a period of time and the relationship broke down completely in Polokwane as a result of the severity of his actions on the 12th of November after the Senegal match. An overwhelming majority of NEC was of the opinion that the relationship with Shakes (Mashaba) was not going to work going forward. In my interactions with the NEC members there was one who disputed my authority to terminate his contract but he was not against the dismissal said Mumble. All these times there were transgressions of the internal codes and we were understanding until that low moment on the 12th of November. We cannot be expected to hold someone by the hand all the time we had many interventions with the media who we do not control but we do our best to intervene. The Burkina Faso comments where he attacked the association for not supporting him by securing a charter (flight) for the team to Ouagadougou (to play Burkina Faso in October) was also not good. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
