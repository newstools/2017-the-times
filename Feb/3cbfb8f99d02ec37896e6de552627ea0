Zuma's daughter with former African Union leader Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma has attacked both ANC head of communication Khusela Sangoni and secretary-general Gwede Mantashe on her Facebook wall.On Friday, Edward Zuma released a statement attacking minister of finance Pravin Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas. He accused Gordhan of having shares everywhere using his connections to make a profit and trying to sell South African Airways to a relative.But Thuthukile, who shocked many of her Facebook friends, attacked Sangoni over the ANC statement, where it expressed shock at the ANC Youth League statement fighting the Gauteng leadership. The youth league had opened a criminal case against former health MEC Qedani Mahlangu over the deaths of 94 mentally ill patients and also called for premier David Makhura to resign.She wrote: ":In my view Khusela's statement about the ANCYL Gauteng puts the ANC into disrepute. This why un-elected officials should not be writing statements on behalf of real elected leadership and about elected leadership. It just puts us in a mess. Can we stop juniorising serious posts in the ANC."Read the full story on SowetanLIVE
