Sunday Times food editor Hilary Biller has been on a mission to find out which supermarkets make the best ready-made meals, snacks and desserts with the help of our readers. Starting in late 2016, and carrying on throughout 2017, we put out calls to readers asking them to join various taste-testing panels. At each tasting session, the readers were presented with a selection of ready-made foods which, if necessary, were prepared according to the packaging instructions by the chefs at HTA Culinary School in Randburg, Joburg. Each product was served 'naked' without packaging or branding. The readers were asked to rate the products according to a selection of criteria such as appearance, taste and texture. An auditor on hand to monitor the objectivity of the blind-tasting process, from removing the packing to numbering the products, overseeing the preparation and adding up the scores. Here's a round up of the winners from each category of the Sunday Times Food Awards.
