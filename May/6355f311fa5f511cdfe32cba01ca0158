At the weekend, speaking at Rhodes University in the Eastern Cape, Ramaphosa seemed to acknowledge finally how serious an impediment to his political ambitions is his role in the Marikana tragedy.In his remarks he revealed that ANC stalwart Winnie Madikizela-Mandela had offered to accompany him to Marikana to offer his apologies in person.At the time of the deaths of 34 miners in a police shooting, Ramaphosa sat on the board of Lonmin and e-mails from him to other board members appeared to show his hand in lobbying the government to escalate its response to protests and violence at the mine.He referred to protesting miners as "plainly dastardly criminals" who should be treated as such. These words and others in the e-mails now haunt him as he hits the hustings in search of popular support in his bid to become ANC president in December.For a man who was once the apple of Nelson Mandela's eye and who played a central role in negotiating South Africa's democratic transition as the leader of the National Union of Metalworkers, the Marikana barb must dig deep.But he faces great political risk in trying to deal with it, despite the Farlam Commission into Marikana ruling that he played no role in the eventual deaths.His weekend utterances have been largely rejected by all the key Marikana players and his spin doctors are already playing down suggestions that he will visit the Marikana families to personally apologise.Should he do so and be publicly rebuffed it will be massively damaging to his campaign but, left unresolved, he will also be unable to recast himself as a broadly popular leader, especially as he courts the left and labour in his bid for power.
