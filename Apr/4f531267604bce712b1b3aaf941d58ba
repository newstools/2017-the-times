Most alarming are its observations about the threat in democratic dispensations, which should in fact be leading the way. Democracies began falling in the index in preceding years and now, more than ever, nothing seems to be checking that fall, the watchdog said. Both the US and UK slipped two places in the index, to 43rd and 40th respectively. Donald Trump s rise to power in the US and the Brexit campaign in the UK were marked by high-profile media bashing, a highly toxic anti-media discourse that drove the world into a new era of post-truth, disinformation, and fake news , it said. South Africa ranked 31st out of the 180 countries and is still considered to be in a satisfactory situation . The report mentions the scandal around Hlaudi Motsoeneng , saying it highlighted the fragility of media freedom and independence in South Africa . But the ranking for South Africa is generous, considering the increasing hostility towards journalists on the ground. A few years ago, a news editor could still assign journalists to protests without having to be too concerned about their safety. Now even protesters are turning on the media. The SA National Editors Forum website shows at least five statements since February condemning incidents of intimidation. We are perturbed by the rising numbers of cases of intimidation and attacks on journalists, especially in the context of both political and service-delivery protests, Sanef said in its most recent statement. Reporters Without Borders gave a chilling warning in its press freedom report: Media freedom has retreated wherever the authoritarian strongman model has triumphed. Let South Africa beware.
