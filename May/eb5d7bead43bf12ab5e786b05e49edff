Mosimane said his decision to introduce fresh legs in the starting lineup was a ploy to counter the visitors who come from high altitude which gives a crucial stamina advantage to the team from the Horn of Africa.The coach is expected to start key players Denis Onyango Khama Billiat and Percy Tau on the bench and give starting opportunities to the likes of Teko Modise Anthony Laffor and Wayne Sandilands. The danger for us is that they come from high altitude and they are runners as a country Mosimane said in reference to Ethiopia s proud marathon-running history. I am thinking that maybe we need different legs because if you remember in the last 20 minutes of our match against Kampala City of Uganda we struggled a little bit because we did not have the legs. I will try to reshuffle a little bit to revive the team by bringing in players with fresh legs and see how it goes. We will do what we have to do we are in this position of being the Super Cup champions of Africa and we can t whinge and cry because Super champs of Africa go out there and fight. Mosimane added that he has managed to get footage of Saint George and that they are a good team who like to play football and will be difficult to beat. We could not get too much footage of them but I have a little bit. They are a ball-playing team and they play very well Downs coach said. I expect a team that play good football because they like to play and they also have a very good physical condition. "It is going to be difficult they deserve to be in the group stages because they are a good team and they will play football. If we can score two goals early we should be okay. We don t want to start the group stages badly because at this stage of the tournament you must win your home matches. You don t want to rely on the last game. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
