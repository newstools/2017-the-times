They are not quite signings to get the pulse racing for City fans but they add depth to a squad that has looked thin at times this season and lost Australian midfielder Matt Sim and Latvian defender Renars Rode in this window.Koapeng has been purchased from NFD outfit Stellenbosch FC and has had something of a journeyman career to date.The 24-year-old came through the development ranks at BidVest Wits and later went on to play for Polokwane City Bloemfontein Celtic Pirates and Royal Eagles.But he has never started more than five leagues in a single season since making his Premier League debut in 2010/11 though he has perhaps now found the right home to shine.Dubula has been a regular for FC Cape Town this season having made his debut in the last campaign.City also previously signed Mozambique international left-back Edmilson Dove in this window and promoted junior Raphael Georgiades to the first team.The club is in their maiden season in the top-flight having purchased the status of Mpumalanga Black Aces after the last campaign and are joint top of the league having also claimed the Telkom Knockout last month. - TMG Digital
