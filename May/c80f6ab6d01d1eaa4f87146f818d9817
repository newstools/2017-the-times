The two clubs have have incurred Safa's wrath after refusing to release players to the South Korea-bound SA side that is to participate in the Under-20 World Cup later this month.The three parties met at Safa House in Johannesburg on Wednesday morning but could not bring the matter to finality. They have not set out a date which means it has been postponed without a date until they get a Fifa directive on whether it is mandatory for us to release the players or not " said Wits chief executive Jose Ferreira.The Wits official attended the hearing with United s head of operations Dominic Busschau and their legal representatives."For now we get to keep our players and nothing has changed. Safa s legal officer Tebogo Motlanthe was not immediately available for comment as he had to rush into another meeting after the hearing.Safa issued a strongly worded statement on Tuesday and they threatened to take action against the two clubs including invoking Article 2.17.18 of their statutes.The rule states that the mother body can suspend fine terminate the membership of or otherwise deal with any member local football association club or individual affiliated to them for engaging in acts of misconduct improper practises misdemeanour acts of defiance or for bringing Safa into disrepute. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
