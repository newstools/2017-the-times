"They have taken up office and fallen into incumbency forgetting that they are accountable to the people who put them there."This must be spoken about frankly. We find ourselves in a time in which open and robust national discourse is in deficit," Motlanthe said at the launch of social justice organisation Oxfam South Africa in Johannesburg."South Africans find themselves laying their heads to rest at night and wondering what changes they will face when they wake in the morning."He reflected on South Africa's democratic journey and the its continuing political crisis, saying it was marked by "the absence of ethical, moral and just leaders".Motlanthe said "recent shenanigans" at state power utility Eskom showed the extent to which public resources were being abused."Eskom is the biggest industrial company on the continent. Transnet is the second-biggest. They are owned by the public but if you refer to recent shenanigans at Eskom you will see a resource that is not being used for the benefit of the people," Motlanthe said."There are people there who expect to be praised for keeping the lights on when that is their only responsibility."Motlanthe's jab at the power utility was made about a week after former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe was reinstated. He left Eskom in November after the public protector questioned his links with the Gupta family, which has close ties with President Jacob Zuma.Motlanthe reminded state enterprises that they are accountable to the public.He said that when state resources were abused for personal gain, the worst affected were the downtrodden.
