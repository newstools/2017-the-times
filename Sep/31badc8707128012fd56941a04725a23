After Trevor Noah walked away with his first Emmy over the weekend, all sorts came out to congratulate him. Even the EFF. "EFF congratulates @Trevornoah for winning his first Emmy for The Daily Show: continue to make us proud," the party posted from its official Twitter page. Of course, Trevor couldn't let that one go. Especially considering a lot of his content is courtesy of the EFF and Julius Malema. Trevor, who is a master impersonator, often pokes fun at Juju. The EFF leader told Anele Mdoda in an interview last year that he didn't think the impersonation was that good. "I realise I'm a difficult person to impersonate. Even Trevor is not succeeding. He is not winning," said Julius.
