French Open champion Rafael Nadal's hopes of a third Wimbledon title were crushed by Luxembourg's Gilles Muller as the Spaniard lost 6-3 6-4 3-6 4-6 15-13 in the fourth round on Monday. The 31-year-old Spaniard battled back from losing the first two sets on Court One but left-hander Muller pounced in the 28th game of the decider for a stunning victory. Muller will face Marin Cilic in the quarter-finals.
