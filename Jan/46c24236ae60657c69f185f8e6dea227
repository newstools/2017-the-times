Ghana s Black Stars have been to five successive semifinals since 2008 but extending that record is going to be tough in Sunday s quarterfinal in the jungle town of Oyem (Kick off 6pm SA time).The third of the matches at the start of the knockout phase will be followed by the fourth and last quarterfinal later on Sunday (Kick off 9pm SA time) when Egypt and Morocco meet in Port Gentil.DR Congo finished top of the toughest group at the tournament edging Morocco into second place and leaving the holders Ivory Coast to go home early.They are a physically imposing side but also with Neekens Kebano in the midfield able to turn on the style and will put into jeopardy Ghana s hopes of continuing in the tournament.Injury to Gyan in their last group match a 1-0 defeat by Egypt on Wednesday - has also clouded maters although an MRI scan showed the injury to not be as serious as was first forecast and he did participate in some of the training that Ghana had on Saturday.Ghana had a lot of problems with transport and training over the last days as the local organisers botched arrangements but coach Avram Grant has shrugged it off.Instead he warned his side to take care to work hard if they are to avoid the fate of several hot favourites already with Algeria Senegal and the holders Ivory Coast out of the tournament."Giants are out of the way so it's a good wake-up call to all the people that think they are a big team and that it's enough " said Grant."It's not enough. You need to prove it on the pitch."Morocco are in the quarterfinals for the first time since 2004 as coach Herve Renard continues on his path to an improbable third title with three different countries.Their win over the holders on Tuesday confirmed their ability but Egypt have also displayed much progress since a tentative start in the opening game with Mali. They are not seven time winners of the Nations Cup for nothing said Renard at Saturday s pre-match press conference.Egypt started tentatively in their opening game against Mali snuck a last minute winner against Uganda and then beat Ghana to finish top of Group D.It is just the kind of slow build up they have shown before on their way to the title. - TMG Digital
