The Nomvula hitmaker's management told TshisaLIVE that Nathi and his team were heading home from the airport, after their flight from Gabon, when they stopped at Milpark in Johannesburg to drop off one of the group members.That was when a gang surrounded Nathi's van and demanded that everyone surrender their belongings.The thugs gave back Nathi's phone after realising who he was, but still made off with possessions estimated to be worth hundreds of thousands of rands.According to those on the scene, the thugs stole at least five cellphones, bags, wallets, cameras, bank cards, fabric and gifts, and the van's keys.Muthaland Records publicist Sipho Nyathela said that the entire team, including Nathi, were left traumatised by the ordeal."It is always traumatic when you are held up at gun point. He was shaken but he is fine and grateful that he is alive and that nobody was hurt. He is back at work and life goes on," Sipho said.He said that they would be opening a case at the Brixton police station in Johannesburg on Monday afternoon.
