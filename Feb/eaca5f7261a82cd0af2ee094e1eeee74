O'Sullivan who is caught in bitter feud between the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) and the national police commissioner Lieutenant-General Khomotso Phahlane was ordered to appear in the Pretoria Magistrate's Court earlier on Thursday.He along with his assistant Sarah-Jane Trent have been charged with impersonating an Ipid officer in a corruption probe by the organisation into Phahlane.O'Sullivan was arrested on Monday but was ordered to be released after police defied a court order which stated that he had to be given 48-hours notice of any impending arrest which he may face.Directorate head Robert McBride on Wednesday told the parliamentary portfolio committee on police that he viewed O'Sullivan's arrest as interference in their investigation into Phahlane.The national commissioner stands accused of receiving kickbacks for awarding chemical supply companies tenders while he was head of the police forensic science laboratories.Phahlane took the Directorate to court last week in a bid to have O'Sullivan stopped from providing assistance to the organisation in its investigation of him [Phahlane].O'Sullivan's bail conditions include that he may not interfere with any State witness he may not go near Phahlane's luxury home in Sable Hills housing estate north of Pretoria he must notify the investigating officers if he plans to leave South Africa and may not reveal to anyone who the State witnesses are.O'Sullivan speaking to The Times by telephone said the court case was a continuation of abuse of power "by those trying to keep corrupt people in their chairs".He is to appear again in court on May 19.- TMG Digital/The Times
