The Bellville Family Violence Child Protection and Sexual Offences unit issued an appeal on Thursday relating to 24-year-old winger who was dismissed by Premier Soccer League club Platinum Stars in May 2016 after missing 10 days of training. He is wanted for a rape case that was reported in February 2013 and a warrant for his arrest was issued said spokesman Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana Anyone with information that can lead to the arrest of Masibusane Zongo is requested to contact the investigating officer Sergeant Van Zyl on 021 592 7092 or 082 522 1095. Zongo s soccer career has been dogged by truancy wayward behaviour and controversy and after his Stars sacking the player s former coach at SuperSport United Kwanele Kopo urged him to take charge of his life and make the most of a two-year deal he signed with National First Division side Royal Eagles. It is about him taking a decision and hopefully his family and the club [Eagles] can give him the support he needs Kopo told Sowetan. Every area presents its challenges and Durban is known as a vibey city. So hopefully he can stay away from those temptations. Zongo was discovered in 2000 by Godfrey Mosoetsa after SuperSport partnered with Dutch side Feyenoord to establish their youth academy.They had under-12 inter-provincial tournaments where Zongo was identified with the likes of Kermit Erasmus and Kamohelo Mokotjo.Kopo said Zongo was well-behaved as a child. He couldn t drink because he was young and the only thing he had was the arrogance that he knew he could play football. Like all good players there were instances of conflict but it was never about drinking. Kopo said trouble started when Zongo was promoted to the senior team and he started with the disappearing acts .He added: I hope he can fulfil his potential. He has the ability to play for the national team but he has to put his life together. It is never too late to change. - TMG Digital/The Times
