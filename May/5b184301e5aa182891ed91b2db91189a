The penalty was handed down after his team spotted a sensor issue on his car and changed the ESS (energy store) and CE (control electronics) on his engine.It's the fifth component of each engine element used by Vandoorne already this year and triggers a 10-place grid penalty as a result.However, after coming a disappointing 19th in qualifying on Saturday, Vandoorne will drop back just one place to 20th and last, behind Russia's Daniil Kvyat of Toro Rosso. Lewis Hamilton starts on pole.Vandoorne, 25, had already been handed a 15-place grid penalty at the Russian Grand Prix two weeks ago for a fourth change.McLaren are the only team along with Sauber yet to register a point in this year's world championship.
