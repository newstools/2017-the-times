Bash Reddy managed to capture the huge mammal taking a stroll in Ledibeng Eco Estate where it walked up Ouhout Street and back around Knoppiesdoring Street.After its outing the hippo was spotted going back to a nearby river which it is believed to live, but not before snapping at - then chasing - two people on a scooter.Steve Anderson who lives at the estate could not believe what he was seeing. That is my street that hippo just took a stroll straight past my house. I actually called my son to warn him because he was riding his bicycle along that road. The last thing I want is to have him confronted by a hippo! Anderson said.
