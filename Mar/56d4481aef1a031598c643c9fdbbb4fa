While the rapper confirmed that he's engaged on the Metro FM Awards black carpet last weekend, he has always kept his romance safely guarded from the spotlight. So getting such an personal snapshot of the man he is away from the stage is a rare occasion. Speaking to Sowetan about the decision to feature his fianc e and daughter on Ngiyaz'fela Ngawe, Kwesta said he wanted it to be "authentic". "The whole story is really just the dilemma between what I do and by what I do I mean ungodly hours of working. It's pretty much the fight between family time and work time because the type of work I do knows no bounds with regards to time and I got a family which requires time. So the whole thing is just explaining the fight and being Kwesta and then having to go home and be the person that is just about family," Kwesta told the publication. The rapper added that when he wrote the song he had real people in mind not actors. In the video there's special moments of Kwesta praying with his family and moments that show the sadness in his family's eyes when he leaves for work.
