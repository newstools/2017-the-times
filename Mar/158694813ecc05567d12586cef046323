Cassper Nyovest dropped the Tito Mboweni music video on Thursday morning, and it's safe to say that Nadia Nakai has stolen the spotlight.The female rapper, who is signed under Cassper's record label Family Tree, only appears in the final 30 seconds of the video. She is wearing an ethnic print bikini, clearly exposing her butt and flawless skin.Twitter couldn't stop praising her ass(ets) and that 30 second scene exposed the thirst thriving on these Twitter streets.After seeing @Nadia_nakai on the #TitoMbowenivideo!! pic.twitter.com/1PanrtFmM8Dear @Nadia_nakai why are you making me pause @CassperNyovest #TitoMboweniVideo pic.twitter.com/55rZ1kDFNO#TitoMboweniVideo let just give a round of applause @Nadia_nakai is a perfect lady pic.twitter.com/9WJxhXYHObAfter seeing #TitoMbowenivideo and @Nadia_nakai @CassperNyovest dope Music Video pic.twitter.com/x7CbtbvXmr@Nadia_nakai Your Doing A Great JOB As A Video Vixen STOP The Other THING Your Trying To Do pic.twitter.com/YviIVkFM8z@Nadia_nakai @CassperNyovest pic.twitter.com/ZutiDxDyoD@Nadia_nakai pic.twitter.com/KGVYo3gWVVI was never ready for the ending part of #TitoMboweni video , @Nadia_nakai .
