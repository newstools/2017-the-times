The state did not oppose bail being granted to Constable Takatso Mashigo 27 as he was in no position to interfere with the investigations. The matter was postponed to February 8 for further investigation.The incident happened exactly a week ago on Grosvenor Street near the Hatfield Gautrain station at around 10am moments after the deceased Oupa Tsakani Shimange 38 had reportedly dropped his partner Sibongile Ntlwane 37 at Sunnypark Shopping Centre in Sunnyside Pretoria.It is alleged that Constable Mashigo and his colleagues were conducting a routine traffic stop and search in the area but Shimange failed to stop bumping Mashigo on the legs twice with his vehicle.Mashigo's lawyer Peter Jay told the court Mashigo received medical attention in prison for injuries sustained to his legs.He said Mashigo will plead not guilty to the charge of murder and will challenge the state's version of events.Family and friends of the deceased travelled all the way from Mashigo's Limpopo home town of Giyani to attend the court proceedings filling courtroom 16. Doors had to be shut to keep more from coming in.Laccy Shimange uncle to the deceased said they accepted Mashigo being granted bail as there was nothing they could do about it. If (the court) think it is fine for them to release him on bail then it is fine he said.Shimange said his nephew will be laid to rest in Giyani Limpopo on Saturday. He said the cottage will leave for the cemetery at 6am. We are going to remember him for his loud Tsonga music he added. TMG Digital/The Times
