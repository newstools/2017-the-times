New research, released on Wednesday, proves that elephants are the mammals that sleep the least.Studies of two matriarch elephants in the Chobe National Park in Botswana revealed that, on average, they slept two hours a night. This is less than elephants in zoos which average double that a night.They sleep even less than horses, which get just under three hours of shut-eye a night. They are way behind the longest sleeper in the mammal kingdom - the brown bat - which sleeps 18 hours a day.Scientists from the University of the Witwatersrand, the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and the NGO Elephants Without Borders were able to peek into the slumber habits of pachyderms by using Fitbit-like activity monitors implanted in their trunks."If you watch elephants they are always moving their trunks, so when they are not moving their trunks it is safe to assume that they are asleep," said Paul Manger, from the School of Anatomical Sciences at Wits University.The team also placed GPS collars with a gyroscope around their necks.Researchers found the two elephants entered a REM state just once every three to four days, which was a surprise. What is more, they only entered the REM sleep phase if they were lying down."REM sleep (or dreaming) is thought to be important for consolidating memories, but our findings are not consistent with this hypothesis because elephants have very well documented proof of long-term memories," Manger said.Manger said their data also suggested that environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity - rather than light - were related to when an elephant fell asleep. He believes this could also assist in understanding how humans sleep.It also appears elephants can go as long as 48 hours without sleep, while they move long distances during the night.Manger now wants to increase the study sample, attaching activity trackers to elephant bulls who roam more.Elephant experts point out that large bull elephants often lean against trees to sleep rather than lying down, since it would be difficult for them to get back up."It would be nice to study forest elephants, desert elephants and Indian elephants to see if their habits differ from this study," said Manger.
