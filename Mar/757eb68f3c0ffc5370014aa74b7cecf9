The book, published on February 28, is top of The Washington Post's list of bestsellers.The newspaper's chief art critic, Philip Kennicott, said the 66 portraits of former soldiers, sold in aid of veterans, show the former president honing his craft."No matter what you think of George W Bush, he demonstrates in this book and in these paintings virtues that are sadly lacking at the top of the American political pyramid today: curiosity, compassion, the commitment to learn something new and the humility to learn it in public."In the book, entitled Portraits of Courage: A commander in chief's tribute to America's warriors, Bush writes about each of the soldiers he depicted.The 70-year-old says he was inspired by the work of Lucian Freud, Wayne Thiebaud, Jamie Wyeth, Ray Turner, Fairfield Porter and Joaqu n Sorolla.He writes a witty account of how he first took up painting, on leaving the White House."For the first time in my 66 years, I picked up a paintbrush that wasn't meant for drywall." - The Daily Telegraph
