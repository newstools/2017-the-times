Everybody that is involved in that conspiracy he said when asked who he was referring to. But your father the president is fingered as suspect number one in state capture interviewer JJ Tabane interjected. My father being the president doesn t therefore necessarily mean he is immune to this and that Edward replied.But later in the interview he appeared to contradict himself: The former minister is just dreaming.
