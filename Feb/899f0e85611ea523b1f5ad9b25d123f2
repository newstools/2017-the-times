Graham played alongside Scott in midfield at Ajax before the veteran left for a spell at Slovan Bratislava in Slovakia.Scott 29 became Wits first signing of the January transfer window and appears likely to line up against his old team-mates on Tuesday night. It will my first time playing against Granwald Scott obviously having played alongside him for a very long time Graham Scott s successor as captain at Ajax said. I am happy for him and what he has achieved. But knowing Bidvest Wits it is going to be difficult because they are title contenders especially this season. Wits have a good squad and knowing coach Gavin [Hunt] and the team he has at his disposal it is going to be a difficult game. They are going to go all in we will have to match that. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
