Spokesman Captain Nqobile Gwala said Nottingham police together with the K9 Task Team arrested three men - aged between 31 and 42 - at Umlazi south of Durban and Impendle outside Pietermaritzburg on Friday night.The Soliks were kidnapped from their home in a Nottingham Road estate last month. Their bodies were found in a river in Impendle nearly 70 kilometres from their home. The members worked through the night searching for the suspects and the information directed them to Umlazi where the main suspect was arrested. Further investigation led them to Impendle where two suspects were arrested and found in possession of two unlicensed firearms and suspected stolen property said Gwala.The trio are expected to appear in the Howick Magistrate s Court on Monday.Earlier this month Thulani Moses Mthembu 43 was arrested for the Nottingham Road murders.
