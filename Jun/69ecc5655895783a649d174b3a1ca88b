At the centre of the dispute is a nine-storey apartment block in the upmarket Currie Road which has pitted developer Serengeti Rise Industries and a group of property owners bordering the development against one another. In 2015 the Durban High Court ruled that a rezoning certificate issued by the eThekwini Municipality was invalid and ordered that the building ostensibly be demolished.Last week the judgment was set aside by the Supreme Court of Appeal after a successful bid by the developer.In the ruling the SCA highlighted that the High Court had declared the rezoning of the building [to allow it to exceed four storeys] unlawful but no order had been made so the city s approval of the rezoning remained in effect.The SCA ruled that the previous order of the court had lacked clarity and was not just and equitable .Advocate Tayob Aboobaker who has been acting for the objecting residents said that funding a Constitutional Court challenge was problematic. I don t have money to approach the Constitutional Court it would be a winner but I am worried about how I would afford the cost order against me if something goes wrong he said. If there is a response from the community and people are prepared to secure the costs of the matter I will proceed to the Constitutional Court Aboobaker added. If we approach the Constitutional Court then they cannot carry on working. If we don t go the building will continue. -TMG Digital/TimesLIVE
