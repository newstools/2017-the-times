Chiefs have conceded late in two games a 3-2 away defeat against Cape Town City then 2-2 draw against SuperSport United at Mbombela Stadium on Saturday.Those results have left Komphela s men in fourth place on 46 points from 26 games five behind leaders Bidvest Wits (51) and four behind second-placed Mamelodi Sundowns (50) although those two teams have played one less match (25).Komphela is of the belief that Chiefs one defeat from 14 matches is evidence that finally he has cracked the winning formula at the Soweto giants. There are so many pluses that to start pointing to them can look like excuses he said of the point that his tenure has reached Amakhosi. But I must tell you with all the pluses one can point at maybe one big negative would be (not) winning a trophy. It would top everything."We only need that to close everything and have this belief. Because there are so many pluses."How we play and I don t want to be arrogant but I strongly believe currently Chiefs are playing a brand of football that is just easy to watch. The energy is there."And go back and look at all the goals we ve scored."They are unbelievable we generate them. And based on that you get this hope."The only thing where you say My goodness could the Gods be with us win these matches for the supporters . You look at Baroka and how we conceded the goal from (Mxolisi) Kunene and a deflection and you re saying But how could it be? "You look at SuperSport in the Nedbank and we missed a penalty in extra time. You look at Orlando Pirates we missed a penalty with five minutes to go."You look at SuperSport now when we drew against them we missed so many one-on-ones so many chances. Who do you fault? You can t fault the players for trying and making that effort. Maybe one thing you would say is Could we maybe need that luck? Because sometimes to win championships you need a lot of luck.
