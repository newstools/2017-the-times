On his release from the Boksburg prison parole centre after serving 28 years in jail, Motsamai knelt to kiss the ground.He said he would work to unite the PAC now that he was out of prison.Motsamai was sentenced to two life terms in 1989 after being found guilty of murdering a white traffic officer in Rustenburg during an Azanian People's Liberation Army-sanctioned bank robbery.He was 26 years old and had just returned from Ethiopia after undergoing military training. Apla was the military wing of the PAC. He thanked the EFF and his lawyer, as well as Mboro, for their support.Motsamai hugged his wife, Mantombi, and daughter Busi, and held his six-year-old grandson's hand.The little boy had spent the day at the prison waiting for his grandfather's release.Motsamai had been on day parole for six months, during which period he had spent a lot of time with his grandson because he never saw his children growing up, said his wife.He was granted parole on Wednesday.One of the first things Motsamai did was to stop at McDonald's for something to eat.Mboro, who drives a flashy BMWi8, joined the family and supporters of the PAC and EFF to welcome Motsamai on his release.Accompanied by a bodyguard, Mboro, whose real name is Paseka Motsoeneng and who is a pastor at the Incredible Happenings Ministries, said he was making the donation for the car-wash business to Motsamai as a "sacrifice".Mboro's R2-million car caused the EFF members to gasp although he insisted he did not have a lot of money.The pastor said Motsamai had attended his church during his day parole."I have prayed for him."Motsamai will not only have a job on his release - he is one of the political veterans who received a state-funded house.He told Sowetan in an interview on January 2: "I'm very happy they've given me a house. Not having a shelter is like not having land, somebody can chase you away at any time."PAC national chairman Phillip Dlamini said there were more than 40 PAC political prisoners still behind bars.
