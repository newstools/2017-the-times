South African athletes 2, administrators 0.And to think that Athletics SA had wanted to send Van Niekerk, Caster Semenya, Akani Simbine to compete at the World Relays instead, which would have left only Olympic silver medallists Luvo Manyonga and Sunette Viljoen.The athletes killed off ASA's idea and set about campaigning to #FillupPotch for the SA Championships. Job done, but not for all the potential superstars. - David Isaacson
