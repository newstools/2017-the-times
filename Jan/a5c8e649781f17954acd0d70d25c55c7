A review into the team's abysmal performances in 2015 was instituted but various hiccups along the way coupled with members of the initial panel excusing themselves saw the review die a premature death.While Nenzani was coy in terms of who was involved in the compiling of the review and the terms of reference he said the review has gone through all the CSA checkpoints and the report is now in their possession. We do have the national team review and we'll be making an announcement in the next week " Nenzani said."We've sat down received and noted the report."From here we are going to make a formal announcement in terms of implementing some of the recommendations and then see how do we align our programs with those recommendations. The aims of the review weren't short-sighted."They are long-term to ensure the mistakes that have been made will not be repeated again."They will have a sustainable blueprint that will take us forward."We know the team has turned the corner but we want to sustain that success."You will see when the report is released. The panel that undertook the review was very professional and is very credible. Nenzani also did not seem to be too worried about the dramatic events that unfolded during the second test at Newlands where it was revealed that Kyle Abbott and Rilee Rossouw will be taking up Kolpak contracts thereby ruling themselves out of national team contention.Nenzani said the loss of players because of the lure of the pound is unavoidable.But he added that CSA cannot allow themselves to be held hostage by the currency nor the players as the game needs to be spread to more parts of the country to ensure cricket does not stagnate. When you look at cricket you also need to look at it as an economic activity and how people need to look at it as something to secure their economic futures."We offer opportunities to everyone in the game but what we can't do is to offer a 10-year guarantee of playing for the national team."The one thing we can't do is to compete with the dollar and the pound."Nenzani also confirmed that an announcement will be made on the launch of the new T20 league next month.
