Nzimande said yesterday that the instability forced parents to send their children abroad to study and prompted academics to turn down appointments in this country.He said the damage to universities' infrastructure during the wave of fee protests last year had cost the sector R7-billion.Nzimande said the governments of some African countries who had been sending their students to South Africa now sent them elsewhere."We must transform - but not destroy - our public education system," he said.Nzimande said Africa was dominated by private universities, some of which were very expensive, which made them inaccessible to the poor and working class.He pleaded with student leaders who were genuinely concerned about higher education to ensure that no harm was done to the system because it would be "disastrous to the children of the poor and the working class".On the failure of the technical and vocational education and training (TVET) colleges, Nzimande conceded that unqualified lecturers, weak management and infrastructure problems caused problems in the sector.The SA Further Education and Training Students' Association last week threatened to shut down 50 of the TVET colleges.The colleges were "a mess", Nzimande admitted."It is a very valid concern. You find someone with an N6 diploma teaching N6 students. You also find that there are lecturers with no practical experience."The Department of Higher Education and Training is partnering with some universities to start offering courses for TVET lecturers.Nzimande's department is to convene a TVET forum that will include student representatives and college administrators.
