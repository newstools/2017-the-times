Councillors at a municipal public accounts committee meeting on Tuesday queried the exorbitant amounts saying some of the consultants were duplicating the jobs of metro staff. According to the auditor-general s report the city spent more than R495 million on consultants. These include private security meter-reading services grass cutting stadium management and transport operations among other services. Budget and treasury political head Retief Odendaal said the city had to drastically cut consultant costs. We should be significantly concerned... in terms of contracted services; how this has been bloated over the years he said at the meeting. Just this past year we spent R495.3 million and the budgeted amount was actually R333 million. This does indicate that this is totally out of control.
