Ayanda has slowly been reviving her social media presence and her heart-wrenching posts have been applauded by her followers.In her latest message, another ode to her husband who died in December, Ayanda thanked Sfiso for loving her in the "right way.""In exchange Ncwane. Thank you for the love that conquered everything. I will tell the fairy tale to my grandchildren one day that there was a man who loved me in a frightful way, after all you knew that your time is limited."
