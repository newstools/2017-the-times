Ayanda posted a picture of herself and described how her life has been completely shaken up."After breaking and being teared into pieces, ready to throw the towel... But MERCY SAID NO! Yebo, many are the afflictions of the righteous BUT the Lord, and only the Lord delivers them from ALL. Thank you to everyone praying for us, loving us even thinking about us. @mawenzancwane insisted i take my first selfie today, i will feel better."

Hmm.! But you said to us "Wethembekile Baba" i'll hold on to that my love." The gospel singer died suddenly in December after being rushed to hospital for kidney related problems.
