 Some of the landowners in the area such as Vergelegen and the Lourensford Estate have taken responsible precautions but may have suffered losses as a result of the neglect of their neighbours " said Guy Preston deputy director-general in the Department of Environmental Affairs.Invasive plants such as pines wattles and gums burnt with an intensity 10 times more than that of the indigenous plants they displaced Preston said on Friday.The 80 buildings burnt in the January 2000 fires that ravaged Table Mountain National Park had been surrounded by invasive plants.Invasive-clearing efforts in the following 15 years meant only eight structures were burned in the March 2015 fires. Seven of these had been surrounded by invasive plants.Firefighters and pilots risked their lives to douse the flames but landowners had not taken the necessary steps to prevent intense wild fires he said."The national provincial and local government firefighters as well as landowners and volunteers have played an exceptional role in preventing potential carnage in the exceptionally strong winds on Tuesday 3 January " Preston said."As with the fires on Table Mountain in 2000 and 2015 we have been lucky with the winds. We cannot count on being lucky all the time."
