Msomi held her calf as she came off in the second quarter of the SANZEA netball quad series match a game the Proteas lost 60-55. Extra time had to be played as it finished 48-48 after four quarters.At the time Msomi went off the Proteas had started falling behind after making a promising start in the first five minutes of the first quarter.Coach Norma Plummer felt some changes needed to be made after they were 8-11 down going into the second quarter. She brought on Izette Lubbe for Msomi at wing attack and Lindie Lombard for Renske Stoltz at goal attack.Msomi's absence affected the team for a little while as they found themselves 11 goals down at half time but the changes eventually had the desired impact and the Proteas started to find more cohesion in attack. Just to be honest I am not injured. It was a tactical decision and as a captain and a senior in the team I would definitely say it was a good call said Msomi. The girls really stepped up especially Izette. I am one of those players who admires a good job and I think she did that. The whole team played very well and I am excited about that. Plummer made the changes because she felt that England had done their homework on Msomi and Stoltz to close them down. You got to understand that in situations it's about getting the team over the line. We have 12 players and we will work those 12 players to make sure we can be in the contest said the Australian born coach. England did their homework. They knew that Bongi and Renske at goal attack is what blew them apart last time [in last year's quad series]."So they knew they needed to cut them out. At that point in time we needed a change. We made the right decision for the team. The Proteas face Australia on Tuesday at 7pm. - TMG Digital
