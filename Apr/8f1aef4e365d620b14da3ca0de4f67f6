The South African Cabin Crew Association (Sacca) said however it may seek to review the ruling and renew its pursuit of an increased international travel allowance.SAA said on Thursday it had to cancel 50 flights on Wednesday as a result of the strike but was expecting only minimal disruptions after a significant increase in cabin crew reporting for duty. Our planned flight schedules have resumed and whilst operations are geared to full service recovery we remain exposed to minimal operational delays SAA spokesman Tlali Tlali said. SAA was assisting all passengers and had implemented a recovery plan to ensure those affected on Wednesday were accommodated.Sacca deputy president Christopher Shabangu said on Thursday the union was considering seeking a review of an interdict granted on Wednesday. SAA had won a labour court interdict only after the union s legal representatives were not able to fully prepare legal documentation and make arguments on Wednesday morning Shabangu said.The interdict expires on June 23 June with the union saying it would likely have determined how to proceed by Friday.Shabangu said SAA had not made significant moves in an attempt to address the union s concerns which also included general concerns over the state of the airline including millions of rand being paid to international consultants on a turnaround strategy for the carrier.SAA said it was committed to a further facilitated dispute resolution process with the union over the next two months. We are hoping that we will be able to come to an amicable agreement with the union that accommodates cabin crew concerns while protecting the financial sustainability of the airline even before the court date in June SAA said.-TMG Digital/BusinessLIVE
