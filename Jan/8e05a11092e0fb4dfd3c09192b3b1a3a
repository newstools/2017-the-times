Kolpak players are legally regarded as overseas players and are not eligible to represent the national team.Lorgat said the decision still needed to be recommended by the board at tomorrow's board meeting and it is simply a case of crossing the t's and dotting the i's.This decision may also have been hastened by Kyle Abbott and Rilee Rossouw taking up Kolpak deals with English county side Hampshire.It prompted the end of their international careers and the termination of their national contracts. One of the things we dealt with at the cricket committee meeting which will go onwards to the board for consideration was the number of Kolpak players we can have in the domestic system."We cannot have places that will be used up by professionals who will not be representing the national team. We need to keep those spots open for those players who want to play for the national team Lorgat said. There will be a number that will be sent to the board for recommendation."There are restraints of trade provisions that one has to consider."Even though I've been made aware that Kyle spoke to Russell some time back it would have been more befitting if I was made aware earlier."We will be putting a limit. Lorgat also said they would not be setting a dangerous precedent by flashing cheques at players who take up Kolpak contracts. I would have engaged in conversation with the players but that would not have included flashing cheques in front of them."I didn't personally engage with them because there just wasn't time but I think they were committed so there was no turning back Lorgat said If someone gives up their right to play for the Proteas there's not much we can do."If you take Rilee for example I don't know how many months we've been treating him and his various injuries and the investment we've had in him hasn't yielded any returns."It's a reality we have to manage and instead of crying over split milk we'll invest in players who want to play for the Proteas under Russell Domingo's guidance. - TMG Digital
