Megan Hancock and Thabelo Masuthu won medals for South Africa at the rowing world under-18 championships in Trakai‚ Lithuania‚ on Sunday. Both hit the podium in single sculls‚ Hancock taking silver and Masutha the bronze. Masutha is the first black rower to win a medal for the country at this age-group‚ sparking dreams that he could follow in the footsteps of Sizwe Ndlovu‚ a member of the golden lightweight four at the 2012 London Olympics. The success of Hancock and Masutha comes soon after SA won two bronze medals at the world under-23 championships. The senior world championships in the US begin in late September. - TimesLIVE
