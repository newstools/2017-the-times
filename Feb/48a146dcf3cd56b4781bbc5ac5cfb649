The visitors didn t even have to shift out of first gear and the Cape side took control of the game after Majoro benefitted from beautiful pass from magician Aubrey Ngoma and scored the opening goal of the match in the 12th minute.The two players returned to haunt Baroka in the second half when Ngoma delivered a perfect cross to Majoro and the merciless striker scored his second of the afternoon.Sibusiso Masina put the game beyond Baroka s reach when he headed the third goal of the game in the 51st minute.The result means that Baroka have conceded eight goals in league two league games they were beaten 5-0 by Wits five days ago and unless they manage to pull a rabbit out of the hat in their 12 remaining games they will be playing lower tier football in a few months time. I am happy for the boys and it was important for us to come here and collect the three points and we managed to achieve that City coach Eric Tinkler said.In the only other premiership game on Sunday Maritzburg United rose from the dead to beat Free State Stars 2-1 in a thrilling premiership clash at the Harry Gwala Stadium.The victory saw coach Roger de Sa s side move up to eighth place on the standings while Stars remain 14th on the table.Stars dominated possession in the early stages of the encounter knocking the ball around nicely in the Maritzburg half of the pitch.Exquisite Ghanaian international Mohammed Anas drew first blood from inside the area in the 21st minute when he scored against his erstwhile employers.However things went south for Stars later in the second half after Evans Rusike and Lebohang Maboe fired past goalkeeper Christoffer Mafoumbi to give Maritzburg a 2-1 lead.Coach Serame Letswaka's side were the better side for the majority of the 90 minutes and could have won this game by a huge margin had they made better use of the many chances they created. - TMG Digital
