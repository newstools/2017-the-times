"I feel like I can go down that hole and dig up my child " said Nombeko Thole.Speaking from her shack at the Jerusalem informal settlement in Witfield Boksburg Thole said her son had gone out to play with another five-year old when he fell into the shaft. She last saw him on Saturday."I can't sleep at night just thinking about where my child is now. He is all alone in there " said Thole.Hundreds of residents gathered at the old shaft including illegal miners who volunteered to help in the search but were turned down by emergency services.She added that he would often play outside close to their home. But this was the first time her son had gone as far as the shaft about 200 meters away."When his friend came to tell us we saw the shock on his face. His eyes were wide open and red " said Thole."I can't cope because it's hurting to think my child is dead. I just want his body so that we can bury him " she added.The distraught mother of three said Richard was her only son and described him as an active and lovable boy."He always played around here and would often come home to check up on me and play with his sister " said Thole. Richard wanted to be a policeman when he grew up.Ekhuruleni emergency services have been working on the rescue operation since Sunday.William Ntladi spokesperson for disaster and emergency management services said an Urban Search and Rescue team and a mine rescue team would work together on Tuesday."We had to call the search off yesterday due to safety reasons. The ground is very unstable the mud slides and lack of oxygen made it difficult to continue " said Ntladi. - TMG Digital/The Times
