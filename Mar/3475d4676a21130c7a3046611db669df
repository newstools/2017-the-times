Twitter sizzled on Tuesday afternoon after it was confirmed that Durban had lost the right to host the 2022 Commonwealth Games.Mbalula took to the social media platform and tweeted: Robert Marawa has a personal vendetta against me with time he will be exposed. I don t have time for chaps like that.""The charge he made that I tried to get him fired from Metro FM he will answer very soon in court period.""I will get my name cleared in a court of law that's my recourse I didn t get anybody fired instead I protected. The latest spat is a continuation of a twar that began two weeks ago after Marawa accused Mbalula of behaving like Tarzan and trying to get him fired at Metro FM.Mbalula said Marawa did not invite him to his sports show on Metro FM and he was not given an opportunity to offer his side of the Durban 2022 fiasco. I have never been afraid to appear at Metro FM Metro station doesn't belong to Robert Marawa " Mbalula tweeted."He didn't invite me to his show to speak about Durban 2022 I am not afraid of this guy."And then Mbalula took things a step further when he alleged that Marawa has in the past used his popular Metro FM sports show to wage wars against Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane former Bafana Bafana coach Ephraim "Shakes" Mashaba and Orlando Pirates and Premier Soccer League chairman Irvin Khoza. "He ran the same campaign against Pitso Mosimane Shakes Mashaba Irvin Khoza and now me. I will never allow it.""So Robert Marawa must run an anti-Mbalula campaign disguised as public discourse nonsense. This vendetta will be exposed It later emerged that Marawa has blocked the sports minister on Twitter and throughout Mbalula s twitter rant on Wednesday the radio personality did not directly respond to him. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
