The video went viral, drawing reaction from across the world, and even made it on to Trevor Noah's The Daily Show this week. Trevor, like many of us, was rolling with laughter as he shared his reaction to the video on his show."No matter how serious you take yourself, kids will mess up your sh*t. Sure, your dad can say, 'I am going on BBC' but the kids are like, 'No, we're going on Ellen'" Trevor joked, before pretending to walk into the room with confidence. Trevor's response was just as funny as the BBC video and is well worth the data.Check it out:Tonight at 11/10c, Trevor reacts to the BBC interview invasion.
