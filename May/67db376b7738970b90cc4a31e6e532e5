The 32-year career of Captain Nicholaas Alberts of Suurbraak near Swellendam was ended in the Labour Court in Cape Town which confirmed his dismissal.The South African Police Service went to court after Alberts successfully appealed against his dismissal and Judge Hilary Rabkin-Naicker was scathing about his lack of remorse. It appears that (Alberts) does not comprehend what the implications of the words he uttered are in this land and under our constitution she said in her judgment issued on April 21.In papers before the court Alberts said he had merely used an idiom during a meeting in January 2014 when staff complained about cost cuts. I was frustrated by the issue and specifically the fact that my hands were proverbially tied he said. I then uttered the phrase whilst tapping on my chest: Dit gaan nie oor my nie ek is nie god van k*****land nie en dit is slegs n spreekwoord . ( It is not about me. I am not the god of k*****land. It is merely a saying. )He went on to say that the phrase was an archaic way of explaining helplessness. It means that one is not a tin god. I did not refer to any person as a k***** . The k-word is not used in isolation but rather in front of the word land . As with many words in the Afrikaans language the k-word can be used in a variety of ways not all of which are insulting. Rabkin-Naicker said the Constitutional Court had made it clear that the use of the k-word on its own or in combination with other words was unspeakable .She said she had agreed to hear the police appeal even though it had approached the court too late because of the importance of this case to employment relations within the SAPS and to the public interest .TMG Digital/TimesLIVE
