Nakhane, who plays the lead in the film about Xhosa initiation rituals and same-sex desires within these rituals, told Mail and Guardian that he was surprised by how much hate he got after starring in the film. "I had prepared myself for a backlash of some sort, but I didn t know it would be quite this homophobic. I knew it would be cultural and that people would be mad about that, but not this homophobia. I mean, people are swearing at my mom. I m like 'what did she do?'. But I kind of understand why people are mad; why they re so defensive of their culture. It is, after all, their culture. But it is also my culture," Nakhane said.He said that some accused him of being "greedy for money" and selling his culture out, but he was committed to the project and its ideals.The musician told the paper that he committed to the film and wasn't going to u-turn on that decision because of the backlash. Nakhane told TshisaLIVE in an interview that he felt the film was important to start a dialogue about cultural taboos in South Africa."I feel like this is a sensitive but crucial story to tell. It highlights things that are often not talked about in our culture but it should be. I tried to treat it with the utmost respect and integrity while still trying to open the debate about the issue. It is only by interrogating culture that we grow and better ourselves," Nakhane said.
