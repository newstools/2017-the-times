The singer, whose real name Sibusiso Desmond Mthembu, took to social media this week to express his frustration at the situation."Kodwa ke things that must remain in 2016 are the people that call me with unknown numbers and just breath! No bafethu ayikho right leyonto!" he wrote.He begged whoever was responsible to stop before he took action."I don't wanna have to change my number. Please stop it! I'm begging and pleading," he added.It is not clear how his number was leaked to the perpetrators and efforts to get comment from Sbu were unsuccessful.Of course, Sbu is not the first celebrity to complain about followers getting his number and calling at all hours.Speaking to TshisaLIVE late last year, rapper Emtee revealed that he had been receiving calls from fans who he claims bought his number on line."I get calls every two minutes from fans asking me for favours and wanting to chat. I can't spend time with my son. I can't do interviews. I can't even go to studio without someone calling me. I am becoming a receptionist for my own phone," he said.
