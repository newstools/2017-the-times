 Her boys were her everything. She wanted to be there when they got home to help with homework and take them to school a close friend and employee at her former work place said.She was described as a social person who loved to host gatherings at her house and last year organised a festive celebration for her eldest son s 21st birthday.Her 14-year-old twin sons survived the incident with one in ICU and the other wounded in both hands.The mother was able to resign from her work and live off money her late husband who passed away from brain cancer two years ago left her and his pension.She had also received a package from her job at Checkers in Fairbridge Mall in Brakenfell. When she left everything was fine and we kept in touch. And then from a couple of months ago I didn t hear from her and she was quiet. It was quite unusual because she always popped in a message on Whats app saying how are you doing or whatever. Always checking up on us. Always phoning. Speculation is rife in the community that she was under financial strain in recent months as a result of investing in a Ponzi scheme.A neighbour said that there didn t seem to be any issues. The neighbour s son visited the household until 7 in the evening prior to the shooting and nothing was out of the ordinary.Her friend has come to her defence and said People can criticise her in many ways on social media and stuff but she was a wonderful and giving person. She always had time for each and every one of us. She wouldn t even harm a fly. TMG Digital/The Times
