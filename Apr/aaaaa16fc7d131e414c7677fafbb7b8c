The 27-year-old nurse from Rustenburg in the North West was the latest bachelor to appear on the show, but after last night s episode, he probably wishes he didn't enter.Not only did he have to go through three rounds of grilling interviews by close friends and family of the people he would be potentially dating, the guy also had Twitter scrutinising his every move.Viewers of the show used hilarious jokes and memes to criticise everything. From Joseph's language to his clothes and the way he held his "fork and knife," he got nailed.#DateMyFamily The belt is critical but stable pic.twitter.com/RVe9E1bDTr Aphelele (@JustAPEX_) April 23, 2017In case you missed #DateMyFamily .
