Who knew that a petrol station could offer so much entertainment? From dumb criminals to lazy hippo’s, here are six times we couldn’t believe what we saw captured on video at a petrol station: How many thieves does it take to load a safe into a boot?  CCTV footage from July this year shows several armed gunmen storming a Western Cape petrol-station store and holding staff members at gunpoint. Unfortunately their attempt to get away with the loot was less than successful. If you've warned a driver repeatedly to put out his cigarette next to a fuel pump, what's the next logical step? Grab a fire extinguisher and help him put it out. The awkward antics of a would-be thief were caught on camera as he tried - and failed dismally - to rob a petrol station convenience store. CCTV footage of the incident was released by the Victoria police in Melbourne, Australia. How far would you go to get away from a potential hijacker? For one woman, her escape attempt included dragging a petrol pump with her. Happy or intoxicated? That's the question after a video surfaced of a Port Elizabeth petrol attendant showing off her dance moves at work. Sandile Saider Nobhala Puti, who posted the video on Facebook, stated that while at first he thought the apparently jovial petrol attendant was part of a marketing stunt he then realised she was in fact 'drunk'. Hippos are a nightly sighting on the verges‚ gardens and streets of St Lucia‚ a popular holiday destination of both locals and international visitors to the iSimangaliso Wetland Park‚ a World Heritage Site. A hippo was filmed as it took a stroll through the petrol station on a main street, unperturbed by all the people and vehicles.
