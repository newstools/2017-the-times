 I think it s a bad idea to recycle leaders he told PowerFM s JJ Tabane on his show Power Perspective. I think I can make a better contribution in continuing to conduct political education classes. This follows a report in the City Press in which Motlanthe was named as one of seven dark horses in the race for ANC president.According to the report he was considered a compromise candidate as well as someone who could bring hope for many in the ANC and the country.Those said to be endorsing him included some of the party elders.However Motlanthe on Monday dismissed this and urged those who were thinking of nominating him to not do so. They mustn t even think about it it is a bad idea. Motlanthe spoke around the question of whether he would support current Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa to take over the reins of the ANC on the principle that the second-in-charge should succeed the president. If you are a national leader and you go out to the general membership to canvass for whomsoever or yourself what do you say to these members? What do you tell them? As I said earlier on elections are meant to strengthen our organisation because it is a free expression of the will of the members. Motlanthe who served as the president of the country briefly after Thabo Mbeki s resignation spoke about how leaders needed to lead by example. To have discipline in an organisation leaders must lead by example and they must be consistent. By that we mean no is no to everybody and not selectively. Once you become selective about it you are encouraging ill-discipline he said.He also denied that he was part of any campaign in support of President Jacob Zuma in the run-up to the 2007 Polokwane conference.
