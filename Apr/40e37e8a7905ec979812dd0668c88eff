The woman who cannot be named in order to protect the identity of the child stands accused of attempted murder and malicious damage to property.She allegedly stabbed the child 19 times.Delivering judgment on the woman's bail application on Thursday Magistrate Gail Pretorius said she was considering referring the woman for psychiatric observation but realised there was no need to do so."This is not normal human behaviour. The accused has breached the child's right to dignity. Her conduct speaks volumes " Pretorius said. "Your erratic behaviour not only makes you a danger to yourself but to society " she told the woman."The court cannot take the risk of releasing you on bail. Your application for bail is therefore denied " Pretorius ruled.She referred the matter to the children's court to make an enquiry about the child's well-being and care.She is being treated for injuries in hospital. - TMG Digital
