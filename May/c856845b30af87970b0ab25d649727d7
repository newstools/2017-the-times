This is according to mineral resources minister Mosebenzi Zwane who spoke about the latest catch phrase in both ANC and government circles.However he failed to provide details of what it entailed and how it would be achieved when probed by journalists.Zwane also declined to be drawn into sensational allegations made by his predecessor Ngoako Ramatlhodi in which he claimed Eskom Chairman Ben Ngubanne asked him to help the controversial Gupta family take control of a mining company that was supplying coal to the power utility during his tenure.Zwane was briefing the media in Parliament on Tuesday as he presented the priorities of his department for the 2017/18 financial year.RET has effectively become the campaign theme of an ANC faction aligned to President Jacob Zuma while his opponents have publicly mocked it as meaningless rhetoric. But Zwane has rejected the criticism.Zwane said a revised mining charter "will be one of the revolutionary tools" in the pursuit of RET.He said his department had found "common ground" with at least 85% of investors and companies that had been consulted over the past year. We believe the charter which will be gazetted will be reflective of the careful and considered consultations which have taken place over the past year. Radical socio-economic transformation is therefore not just a buzzword or rhetoric as some public commentators have claimed said Zwane. Last year we outlined our priorities for the 2016/17 year as enhancing legislative and policy certainty mine health and safety and meaningful socio-economic transformation as our priorities said Zwane.Turning to Ramatlhodi's revelations Zwane sidestepped the questions."You must allow the former minister to answer on what he says said Zwane.
