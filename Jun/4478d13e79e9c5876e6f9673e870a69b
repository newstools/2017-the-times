That price was a total of 191, a low hurdle that India hopped in 38 overs to win by eight wickets.India burnished their reputation as a team who seize the moment and with it the trophy: they have won the World Cup, the Champions Trophy and the World T20 in the past 10 years.South Africa confirmed that when the kitchen heats up they head for the garage.AB de Villiers' men seemed on course for a substantial score while Quinton de Kock and Hashim Amla were compiling their partnership of 76 - South Africa's highest opening stand in the tournament.Drama did not seem imminent when Amla cut Ravichandran Ashwin into MS Dhoni's gloves in the 18th over and when De Kock reached 50 it was noted that all five times he had made that in ODIs he had gone on to a century.Not this time. De Kock scored 53 before swiping past a delivery from Ravindra Jadeja that nailed his off-stump.Even so, at 116/2 and not quite halfway, South Africa seemed set to post a total that could compete with India's potent batting order.Five overs later the madness struck.At 12.24pm Faf du Plessis nudged Jadeja to point and tried to take a single that was not there - and even a full-length dive by De Villiers could not stop one of cricket's most fleet-footed players from being run out.At 12.29pm Du Plessis cut Ravichandran Ashwin to short third man, set off on a run, changed his mind and returned to his crease, and looked up to see David Miller at the same end.The ball was delivered to the other end and after much deliberation it was decided that Miller was the one to go.In the space of those five minutes and the six deliveries they encompassed, South Africa's hopes of staying alive in this tournament ebbed to a new low.Up in the dressing room, De Villiers sat ashen-faced and holding a pen. Might he have been composing his resignation from the captaincy or even his international retirement?
