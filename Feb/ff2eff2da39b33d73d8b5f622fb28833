 It is quite clear that Molefe will make his way up to the Cabinet. Mr Zuma and his faction in the ANC wants to see the back of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan said COPE spokesman Dennis Bloem. This is a disgrace and total insult on the Office of the Public Protector who has named Brian Molefe in the Capture of State Report as one of the people implicated as captured by the Guptas he added.Bloem said the ongoing attacks by the ANC youth and women s leagues Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and calls for him to be fired were a clear indication that the Gupta agenda to capture the State is in full swing . COPE is reliably informed that Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma another Gupta deployee will be sworn in alongside Brian Molefe Bloem charged. Brian Molefe left Eskom under a dark cloud and now Zuma and the ANC are deploying him to Parliament to further tarnish the already badly damaged image of this institution. Law abiding citizens can easily conclude that Parliament has become a safe haven for corrupt ANC crooks because even the President of the ANC is fingered in the Capture of State Report and must still face 783 corruption charges in court Bloem asserted. We are more than ever convinced that Zuma and his vultures want to deliver the final blow to Pravin Gordhan and get hold of the Treasury. That is their main mission to loot Treasury and leave the country bankrupt he added.
