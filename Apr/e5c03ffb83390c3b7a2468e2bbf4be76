The ANC backed Zuma after numerous calls for his resignation in the wake of the dismissal of respected finance minister, ANC Secretary General Gwede Mantashe said.The rand fell by 1 percent and bonds weakened after Mantashe said the ANC would not be part of a movement to remove Zuma, despite a chorus of criticism by ANC-allied parties and unions, religious groups, civil society and the opposition.Mantashe said the ANC had accepted the "irretrievable breakdown of the relationship" between Zuma and former finance minister Pravin Gordhan as the reason Gordhan was sacked, a move that deepened a rift within the ruling party.Previously Mantashe had stated discomfort with the decision."I'm very uncomfortable because areas where ministers do not perform have not been touched," Mantashe said."We can't be happy (with the decision to sack Gordhan) because we think that the finance minister was a hard worker.""The president came with a list. (He) said 'you can comment if you want to comment, but this is my decision,'" Mantashe said.Here is how South Africans responded on Twitter:What dark secrets does Zuma have on Gwede Mantashe &amp; Co?
