Blessings to everyone there. Thank you for the love," he tweeted.He claimed that the label had "taken back" what they thought made him happy and had threatened his and his family's future.Major League DJz have yet to respond to Malema's statement.Malema made headlines in August last year when he said during a live press conference that the company, which is headed up by ANC Youth League treasurer general Reggie Nkabinde, paid no less than R5 million to artists signed to the label. He further added that Mabala was allegedly funded through "dodgy government tenders".Reggie rubbished the claims and said that the company was looking into taking legal action against the EFF leader.
