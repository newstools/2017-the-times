Chef Patron at Fusion French Caf Shaun Smith revealed the CCTV footage on his Facebook page.The cellphone belonged to young chef manager Gavin Munro. It was a busy service day I am usually always in front of house but on this day I was called into the kitchen for something. I left my phone behind the counter under a dish cloth I thought I made an effort to hide it but it was charging and I think the charge cable is what gave it away Munro said.If anyone sees this thief... my poor chef manager has had his phone stolen at our Fusion French Cafe ... not cool... pisses me off! #thief According to Munro two men had walked in earlier and were acting strangely. The men were actually in for an hour or two we were suspicious because we kept finding them in places they weren t allowed entering Munro said.Smith said that he was very disappointed about the incident. I am sad that a young chef has been disadvantaged by such a blatant crime. I just want to warn other restaurateurs to be on the look out for these two if they did it at our restaurant they probably won t hesitate to do it at anyone else s Smith said.A case of theft had been opened but Munro said that he wasn t very hopeful that he would see his phone again. I think this was a learning experience; we should all be very careful and conscious of our surroundings. Don t ever be too relaxed with your belongings even if people look well dressed you can never be too cautious said Munro.- TMG Digital/TimesLIVE
