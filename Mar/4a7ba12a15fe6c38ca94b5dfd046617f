During his cross-examination of South African Football Association (Safa) media officer Matlhomola Morake Mashaba's lawyer Claudio Bollo said the reason the public broadcaster did not flight the video of the incident on Saturday November 12 was because it was not newsworthy until it was linked to the ex-Bafana Bafana mentor the following day."Mr. Mashaba then didn't do much wrong and has never given a bad post-match interview as Bafana Bafana coach " he said.Bollo said Mashaba had been good at post-match interviews.He added that Mashaba greeted crowds at stadiums after almost every game before moving to the post-match interview.On Wednesday it also emerged that Safa president Danny Jordaan tried to have the interview that got Mashaba fired canned but it was too late.Morake said that it boggled his mind that Mashaba did not stick to the script during interviews and press conferences.According to Morake he would sit down with Mashaba a few hours before a Monday press conference after having read weekend and daily newspapers.He said Bafana Bafana players and officials assemble for camp on Sundays and there was always an obligatory press conference on the following day to update the nation on who has reported for national duty injuries and other football-related matters.Morake said he would also help Mashaba prepare for the squad announcement press briefing.However Bollo said his client denies the meetings where he was coached on how to deal with the media took place.In terms of the Safa communications policy which Mashaba was fired for flouting among other reasons employees are not allowed to comment in the media about its policies procedures without the approval of the association's chief executive Dennis Mumble.Safa also does not allow its employees to talk about the association in the third person "as if you are not part of it".The policy also bars employees from talking about grievances in the media before exhausting internal remedies as well as cast aspersions on Safa and its officials.Safa's lawyer Mark Thompson said employees were not allowed to attack their employer.On Tuesday Bollo said Mashaba was not unlikable to everyone and that he had sections of the public that loved him and those that hated him. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
