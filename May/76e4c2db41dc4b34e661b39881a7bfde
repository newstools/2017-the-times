"The past few weeks have been really cool. Obviously got married and went on honeymoon and enjoyed that," McIlroy said at Sawgrass on Tuesday. "Got back home to Florida last Thursday, been trying to lose a bit of weight before this week ... but, yeah, everything's been great." The 28-year-old signed a reported $100-million deal to switch to TaylorMade for the next 10 years. He had an equipment deal with Nike before it announced late last year it was pulling out of that market. The world No2, who signed a long-term extension to his Nike apparel contract in April, said he decided to switch to TaylorMade's clubs and balls from this week after feeling a lack of control with his shots in windy conditions. "So I sort of went back to the drawing board and tested for about 10 days pretty extensively after Augusta, worked with a lot of different things," he said. "Saw stuff with the golf ball, that new TP5x ball that they have, and I thought, wow, this is what I need, this is exactly the thing that I've been struggling with. "Then over the next few days, I tested different combinations [of clubs], a lot of different stuff, and I came to the conclusion that was the best way forward for me to try to improve, try to win more, try to get back to world No1, try to win more majors." McIlroy said he felt like he was starting "a new chapter in my life ... but I really feel with the new equipment as well, it's hopefully going to take me to that next level". The four-time major winner did not think his intensity and focus on the golf course would change now that he is married, but thought it could be beneficial off the course. "It might help me get over tough defeats a little easier," he said. "I'm in a great place in my life. I feel very settled and very lucky to be in this position. Now it's just about trying to make the most of the fortune I've had."
