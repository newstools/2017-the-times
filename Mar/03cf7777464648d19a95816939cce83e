"I can assure my fans that 50% of my album, which I am working on, will be love songs," the singer revealed in an interview with TshisaLIVE.The singer's debut song Themba, which shares a name with her sister Kelly's song Themba, was released late last year but the direction of her music was not clear.Zandie explained that she felt like love was one of the simplest things to write about because if you are lucky you are exposed to it all you life. "I co-wrote Bittersweet with my producer Sqelo, a producer from Durban, and it turned out the way it did because I choose to sing about something that I know."I have learned a whole lot about love and marriage and I feel like people will be able to relate to Bittersweet. It talks about the good and bad times; like how sometimes you are so happy and other times you want to leave but your heart won't allow you. It is a very motivational love song," Zandie said.The songstress started off as a back-up singer for her sister Kelly. But Zandie decided last year that she wanted to step into her own light. She added that the other 50% of her album will be a fusion of music genres, which she felt fans would appreciate."As much as I sing about love, I feel my fans will appreciate getting to know different shades of my music," she said.
