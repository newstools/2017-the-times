The site which has editions in 17 other countries outside the US including SA will now change its name to HuffPost. Its SA edition was launched last year under the Media24 stable.Editor-in-Chief Lydia Polgreen said in an interview published on the site on Tuesday that the name change reflects what our readers call us anyway .HuffPost has received backlash in recent times for poor internal controls as it repositioned itself to grow its network of unpaid contributors.Its editor in-chief for its SA edition Verashni Pillay resigned last week following the release of the findings of the press ombudsman that a blog published on the site was malicious and discriminatory .The HuffPost was ordered to apologise to the public for publishing the racist and sexist blog that incited hate speech titled Could It Be Time To Deny White Men The Franchise? .In a strongly worded finding Press Ombudsman Johan Retief said Pillay had violated various sections of the Press Code and had contributed to the erosion of public trust in the media .In a post on the site earlier on Tuesday Polgreen said in the months ahead readers will see much more original journalism.
