While the Sharks made the quarter-finals of last year's Super Rugby tournament before being unceremoniously dismembered 41-0 by eventual champions the Hurricanes Mvovo has high hopes for the Robert du Preez coach side. It's all about taking care of home at this point in time and now the Sharks are home " he said. "The Springboks are only in action in June and I'm not looking that far ahead."There's still a lot of rugby to be played and there's a lot that still has to happen. I'm looking at Super Rugby and what's important for the brand at the moment."We've got something good going on here and I don't want to spoil that by looking too far ahea There have been some great squads here and I don't want to take anything away from them."There was a time when we once went to two finals and I can see a lot of similarities with this squad and the ones that went to the finals."The youngsters that have come in and are hungry. They are working hard so we can bring back the winning rugby and the winning culture at the Sharks. Coach Du Preez had the benefit of watching from the sidelines as the Sharks based their game on a solid defensive system that reaped dividends for them against the New Zealand sides.It may have come apart in the Wellington quarterfinal but the Sharks will have a easier ride this year against the weaker Australian sides.Mvovo was loathe to compare the eras but there were shades of a developing attacking game in the Currie Cup even though the Sharks did not get to the playoff stages.Mvovo is not banking on the Australian sides to roll over and die but he feels their travel schedule will make life easy for them this year.The Sharks begin their season with away games to the Reds and the Brumbies. There's a different feeling here and as a whole in the Sharks company we're working towards a similar goal and that's winning."We need to bring the crowds back and I think Rob is doing an excellent job especially when we down to Port Shepstone for a pre-season camp to do our culture and set out our stall for the next three years Mvovo said. - TMG Digital
