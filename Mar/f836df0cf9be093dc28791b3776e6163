His axing was sweet justice in a day when this self-important peacock strutted the stage. He threw a public tantrum and publicly denounced his critics after our sister paper, the Sunday Times, revealed how he had orchestrated to sign off a 350% salary hike - to R5.9-million - for himself. Unbelievably, he apparently also tried to arrange to be chauffeured and given a phone with an unlimited allowance by his employer, which is ultimately us taxpayers.Now he's been sent packing back to his job at the transport department, but the story should not end there. He should also be suspended and disciplined by his transport bosses for his conduct at Prasa. Not only did a legal opinion commissioned by the Prasa board find that Letsoalo may have been guilty of misconduct in his actions while at the agency, the transport department is going to have to refund Prasa the exorbitant salary he was drawing.But, while some kudos must go to the Prasa board for acting so swiftly on Monday, questions must be asked about how these machinations were able to unfold without their being noticed. That they could occur at all indicates paucity of oversight and corporate governance principles in our state-owned entities.But, aside from this, there was another valuable lesson this week - that of the importance of a free and independent press.Vilified by some on Monday, today the Sunday Times stands proud, true to its tradition as an aggressive watchdog.Without it, Letsoalo, a puffed-up bureaucrat, would have been living the life of a prince on our dime.
