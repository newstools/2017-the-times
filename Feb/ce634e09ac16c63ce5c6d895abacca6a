The Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa s Board of Control (PRASA Board) have unanimously agreed to terminate the secondment of the Acting Group CEO Mr. Collins Letsoalo with immediate effect. This comes after the controversy behind the remuneration package of the Acting Group CEO which the PRASA Board views in a dim light. According to reports the Acting Group CEO has authorised a salary hike irregularity. The PRASA Board would like to place on record that that no Board Resolution was adopted regarding such a salary increase nor payment of an annual salary package of R5.9 million. In fact the agreed and official salary remains the R1.3 million annual package which was approved by the Minister of Transport as the terms of the secondment package which were agreed upon by Mr. Letsoalo. That all matters pertaining to the alleged authorisation of the salary hike by the Chairman of the Board in a letter was part of the considerations on the extent of Mr. Letsoalo s added duties at PRASA during his secondment period. This letter did in no way give an automatic authorisation of a salary increase without following due process as clearly stated in the letter from the Chairman of the Board. The PRASA Remuneration Policy on acting positions provides for an increase not exceeding 12% of the package on the acting position. According to PRASA s Human Resource (HR) policy relating to Group CEO salary packages it is the prerogative of the Human Capital and Remunerations Committee part of the PRASA Board Committee to recommend such changes and communicate such to the Human Resource Executive concerned. In the case of Mr. Letsoalo this was not done subsequently flouting all procedures and protocols in this regard and leaving the Board with no choice but to terminate his temporary tenure with immediate effect. The process of appointing a permanent PRASA Group CEO is currently under way with advertisements already out in the relevant Sunday papers.
