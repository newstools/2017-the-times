He will not be on the bench again this Saturday in Nelspruit.Tembo said that there has been communication from Baxter during games. This seems most likely to have been via cellphone and SMS with the SuperSport bench while the coach watches on TV. He s with us. Even in the Wits game he was with us former SuperSport and Zimbabwe defender Tembo said. We communicate we talk so that win was for the coach. The coach did everything on the night. So he might not be here but he s always with us. Tembo praised his players for bouncing back from three league defeats in a row against Wits. We needed to get back into the mix for the league. Because we want to finish as high as we can the SuperSport assistant said. I think the attitude against Wits was unbelievable. Because to play 120 minutes on Saturday against Chiefs then go and put on a performance like that against Wits on the Tuesday that is unbelievable. We ve just played Chiefs and we re playing them again on the weekend. It s part and parcel of the game. We knew it was going to be difficult in terms of matches. We ve been playing back-to-back matches and we just need to deal with it.
