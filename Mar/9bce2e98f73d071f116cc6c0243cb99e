He told TMG Digital he had taken many calls from people him thinking he was the one who had been killed."This is quite sad. This shouldn't be happening in local government " Sithole said."I knew Sbu very well. He was a very hard working young man."I don't know why he was killed because he had resigned already. His post was advertised yesterday. I gather there were people who didn't want him to leave " said the man who once styled himself as the doctor of sick municipalities.It's the second time a Richmond municipal manager has been gunned down. A few years ago Sanele Nxumalo was ambushed and shot while in Tongaat. Richmond is one of the seven municipalities under uMgungundlovu District Municipality.Last year in June Simo Mncwabe a CFO from Mooi/Mpofana also under uMgungundlovu District and Nathi Hlongwa a local economic development at uMgungundlovu District were shot dead just hours apart. The two men were senior office bearers in Ward 12 of the ANC's Moses Mabhida region.- TMG Digital/The Times
