The Fifa Council decided on Tuesday not to renew the mandates of Borbely and chief ethics judge Hans-Joachim Eckert, who had led the cleanup attempt at world football's governing body, and nominated Colombian Maria Claudia Rojas and Greek Vassilios Skouris as their replacements.Borbely and Eckert labelled the move "de facto the end of reforms" at Fifa and said it was a setback for attempts to clean up its operations.Several dozen soccer officials, mainly from Latin America, were indicted in the US in 2015 on corruption-related charges, sparking the worst crisis in Fifa's history. Among officials now banned from the sport are former Fifa president Sepp Blatter and secretary-general Jerome Valcke.Fifa president Gianni Infantino was also investigated by the committee but was cleared in August 2016.Speaking at a news conference, Borbely said the move was a "setback for the fight against corruption"."We investigated several hundred cases and several hundred are still pending and ongoing at the moment," Borbely said.
