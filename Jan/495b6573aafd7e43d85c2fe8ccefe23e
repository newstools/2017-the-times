In a Cape Town high court judgment on Friday Judge Ashley Binns-Ward was scathing about the decision by the council s former head of building development management Peter Henshall-Howard to give the go-ahead for development of the Oracle in Buitenkant Street.The body corporate of the neighbouring building Four Seasons successfully applied for a judicial review of the council decision after obtaining an urgent interdict to halt work in 2012.In his review ruling Binns-Ward ordered the council to reconsider the planning application by the Oracle s owners the Simcha Trust and to ensure that neither Henshall-Howard nor the staff member who drew up the report recommending approval were involved.The Four Seasons body corporate complained that the Oracle extension which has remained incomplete since the interdict was granted had the effect of turning eighth-floor balconies into courtyards confined between towering walls .For apartments on the 9th and 10th floors it meant that their view was replaced by a blank wall only three metres from their windows.Binns-Ward who inspected the site before hearing the case said the case was not about the loss of a view or about the appearance of the Oracle building.Instead it was about something so exceptionally intrusive and objectionable that it would not reasonably have been foreseen by anyone buying a Four Seasons flat.He added: A local authority is required in a sense to act as a moderator in respect of potentially conflicting rights and obligations of neighbouring property owners. Henshall-Howard had displayed a fundamentally misguided belief that (the law) allows an uncoordinated and potentially disharmonious approach to planning applications he said.Though Henshall-Howard had since retired he still did ad hoc work for the city council. It is desirable ... that someone without his preconceived opinion should decide the matter said Binns-Ward who awarded costs against the council for what he called its actively oppositional role .TMG Digital/Sunday Times
