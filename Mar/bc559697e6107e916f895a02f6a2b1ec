"The sniper shot him in the head. His family was all around him, the children and his wife, they were crying," said Maysun, who saw the shooting as she fled Mosul's Maamun neighbourhood."They didn't want to leave his side, but we made them continue because it was so dangerous," the 35-year-old said at a camp for the displaced near Iraq's second city.More than 28,000 people have streamed out of west Mosul since February 19, when security forces began a push to wrest control from the Islamic State group, according to International Organisation for Migration figures.They are fleeing fighting and food shortages, but they face horrifying scenes as they leave."There were bodies in the street as we walked, children, pieces of bodies," said Safana, 23, as she waited in a food distribution queue in the Hamam al-Alil camp.She said IS fighters had told people to leave her neighbourhood of Maamun in west Mosul."They came in the morning and said if we hadn't left by evening they would kill us," she said.Iraq's elite Counter-Terrorism Service has faced "fierce" resistance from IS in southwest Mosul, and the jihadists have targeted fleeing civilians, according to senior commander Staff Lieutenant-General Abdulghani al-Assadi.He said about 15 fleeing civilians had been killed by jihadists in the past 10 days, with more wounded.Safana, who like many of those fleeing Mosul declined to give her family name, said civilians had been trapped in their homes during heavy clashes."Our neighbour's house was hit by a mortar round and the whole house collapsed on top of them."Among those killed elsewhere in the area known as the Maamun Flats was 10-year-old Rusud Saddam, whose mother was inconsolable as she walked along a highway to reach transport to a camp for the displaced."My daughter was standing in the corridor in the house; the mortar round hit and she's gone," she wept."They broke my heart ... I left her in the cemetery. I left her in the cemetery and I came." Some of the displaced were moving from areas already under Iraqi military control, afraid of the ongoing fighting and eager to move to safety.Others escaped across the front line, waiting until they saw Iraqi forces in the distance and running towards them with white flags. At the Hamam al-Alil camp, 4,000 tents have been put up to receive arrivals, and more than 14,000 people have already been registered, said administrator Nader Samir.He said the camp, run by a local NGO with UN support, was struggling with several basic problems, including medical resources, food and petrol to run the generator.
