This is according to the South African Transport and Allied Workers Union (Satawu) which said it had successfully requested Oliphant to intervene in the ongoing impasse.Workers affiliated to unions in the South African Road Passenger Bargaining Council including Satawu downed tools on Wednesday demanding a 12% across-the-board wage increase and better working conditions. A meeting to resolve the impasse on Wednesday afternoon did not produce an agreement.Even though employers upped the offer to 9% across-the-board from the initial 7.5% they would not commit to improving working conditions in the industry.Unions rejected the offer outright and vowed to continue the strike that has left thousands of commuters stranded.Satawu spokesman Zanele Sabela said the union lobbied Oliphant to meet with all parties to resolve the deadlock in the interest of the public and commuters in particular.Satawu said the meeting is set for 10am on Friday and parties to the negotiations would be contacted with details of the location.
