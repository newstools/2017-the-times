At least five gang members one armed with a pistol and four others with hammers robbed NWJ Fine Jewellery in the Sanlam Centre in Empangeni of an undisclosed amount of jewellery on Friday.Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said the brazen robbery took place at about 10am. The gang used hammers to smash the display glass in the jewellery store and helped themselves to watches and other items.The robbers fled with their loot. No one was injured during the daylight robbery.The Empangeni robbery follows that of a jewellery store Cajee at Gateway in Durban on Monday night.Five men armed with crowbars and hammers made off with watches.A security guard at the store was robbed of his cellphone wallet and two-way radio. While he lay on the floor under a table the robbers made their way to the Cajee store. The robber armed with a crowbar broke through the bottom latch on the door kicked the door open and his accomplices entered the shop.Using a hammer the robbers smashed the glass and stole more than 20 watches before calmly walking out of the mall and speeding off in a silver-grey Toyota Collora.Less than 24 hours earlier a gang of about seven men wielding hammers and crowbars smashed their way through the Osiniq Jewels at the Hilton Hotel in Durban and stole jewellery worth R2-million.The gang entered the hotel lobby and held up the security guard before smashing the shop window. The gang fled in a silver-grey Mercedes Benz.Police have noted an increase in the number of jewellery store heists by men using hammers and have urged business owners to beef up security.It is not yet known whether the Hammer Gang is the same syndicate that hit Durban in 2004.Chris van Rensburg chairperson of the Jewellery Council of South Africa this week said jewellery stores had become soft targets for criminals. He attributed the spate of robberies to little cohesion between the police and judicial system and the shortage of manpower in the police to bring criminals to book.He said that jewellery stores were notified of crime trends but there is little we can do besides not having jewellery on display .In a brazen robbery two years ago a gang of men wearing construction overalls and wielding firearms and sledgehammers stormed the upmarket Harris &amp; D'arcy Jewellery store in the Blue Route Mall in Cape Town and smashed their way to jewellery worth millions of rands.
