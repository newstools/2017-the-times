"Although [this] is enough reason for concern, the prevalence of stock-outs might be higher," say Charlene Sunkel and Marth Viljoen of the SA Federation for Mental Health.Writing in this month's edition of The Lancet Psychiatry, they say drug shortages threaten patients with relapse, loss of employment and social isolation.Sunkel and Viljoen quote from a survey of 109 patients carried out last year by the SA Mental Health Advocacy Movement."The service users indicated that the unavailability of medication had affected their lives in various ways."They reported a noticeable effect on their mental wellbeing; 30% experienced a complete relapse resulting in hospitalisation; 30% experienced some symptoms surfacing but did not require hospitalisation; 17% experienced changes in sleeping patterns; and 23% experienced increased anxiety."The burden of mental, neurological and substance use disorders on public health increased by 41% bet-ween 1990 and 2010, "and is increasing", say Sunkel and Viljoen."The National Mental Health Policy Framework and Strategic Plan 2013-2020 in South Africa makes the commitment that 'all psychotropic medicines, as provided on the standard treatment guidelines and essential drugs list will be available at all levels of care, including primary healthcare clinics'."But this is not being implemented. "Being unable to receive the correct, prescribed medication places users of mental healthcare in a situation that can result in a deterioration of mental health functioning and, worst case scenario, relapse."This can have several negative and long-lasting consequences, such as readmission to inpatient facilities, loss of employment, a breakdown in family relationships, poorer quality of life and social isolation."Increased relapse rates place unnecessary strain on a mental system that is already overburdened and under-resourced in many cases."Tracey Feinstein, operations manager of the SA Depression and Anxiety Group, told The Times: "The moment anyone is diagnosed with a mental illness and there is no access to medication, there is a possibility of a relapse."Health Department spokesman Joe Maila did not respond to requests for comment.
