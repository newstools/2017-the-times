The bride and groom, Innocent and Vincent Ngobeni, showed off their cultures beautifully on Sunday night's episode of Our Perfect Wedding.Their wedding was rated as one of the best by Twitter because of the colourful decor, their helicopter entrance, catering for 1,500 guests and a surprise change of wedding dresses.However, the choice of the OPW's participants to speak mostly their language, which is Xitsonga, left Twitter confused and concentrating hard on the subtitles to understand what was being said.Native Tsonga people were overjoyed at the use of their language in the show while other tweeps were just catching feelings:#OurPerfectWedding Im expecting this today pic.twitter.com/1GpMCGVF51Yoh 1500 people #OurPerfectWedding pic.twitter.com/b3ME6r38QzWhy are people catching feelings? #XiTsonga is an official language yaseMzansi, get a life. #OurPerfectWedding pic.twitter.com/PEddwIHGADDaddy is loaded neh?
