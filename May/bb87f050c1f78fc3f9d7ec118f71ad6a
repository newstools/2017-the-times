In a report titled "Violent Extremism in South Africa", the Institute for Security Studies said that 60 to 100 South Africans had joined Islamic State in Iraq and Syria between 2014 and 2015.According to the report's co-author, Raeesah Cachalia, about half of those who left had "willingly" returned by August last year after "growing disillusioned with the [terrorist] group".Cachalia said those returning then included many women and young children who were not a major security threat because they had not been involved in the fighting.But, she said, a new wave of more militant recruits was likely to come home."The concern now is that with IS having suffered so many territorial and other defeats [recently], many of the others may be on their way home now - not for the same reasons as the others in the first group, but because they were forced to come back."Cachalia said the new wave of returning IS fighters should not be treated in the same way as the women and children who preceded them because "they might have been involved as combatants"."The question now is how the government should deal them," she said.
