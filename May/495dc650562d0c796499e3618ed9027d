The owner bought the 26-carat, cushion-shaped, white diamond ring for 10 in the 1980s and wore it while shopping and doing housework, thinking it was merely costume jewellery, Sotheby's said."The owner would wear it day-to-day. It's a good-looking ring," said Jessica Wyndham, head of Sotheby's London jewellery department."No one had any idea that it had much intrinsic value."Most of us can't begin to dream of owning a diamond that large."The diamond is thought to have been cut in the 19th century, when the style was to cut to conserve the weight rather than to make it as sparkly as possible, hence its relative lack of brilliance."It could trick people into thinking it's not a genuine stone," said Wyndham.She said the owner, who does not want to be named, brought the ring in after a jeweller told her "it might be worth something".She said the owner was "incredibly excited - it's a life-changing amount of money."This is a one-off windfall, an amazing find."The ring will be auctioned on July 7.
