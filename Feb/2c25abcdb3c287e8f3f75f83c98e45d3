He was delighted with a 1-1 draw against Kaizer Chiefs at the Athlone Stadium on Saturday and somewhat taken aback at the post-match press conference when reporters suggested a possible slump as Ajax have picked up just two points from a possible 12 since the mid-season break. You have to stop you are putting us in a negative light an irritated Menzo said to his inquisitor who had asked about the failure to win in the last four matches. We ve played only against top teams this year. We have played against Chiefs we have played against Wits and we have played against Cape Town City."What do you want? That we beat them all? Don t forget that we have played against top teams (since the restart). You are making the players to feel like they are nothing."The only thing I was not very satisfied with was the 5-0 loss to Wits (on Feb. 7)."But just because we had some good results before the break it doesn t mean that when you take on top opponents you are going to beat them."When the former Dutch international took over as coach from Roger de Sa in October last year Ajax had just two points and were bottom of the log.But they won five out of eight games before Christmas including beat champions Mamelodi Sundowns. Let s be reasonable " an annoyed Menzo said."Let s think realistically. We did very well against Chiefs we did well against City and we did well against Polokwane who are sixth on the log."Don t forget who we are and were we came from. You can t change that in one second in a few week or a few months."I tell my players don t let people tell you negative things . We have to win the games against the teams who are around our position on the log. Only if we don t win those then you can say things are not good. But at this moment I think it s not fair to say that we are on a dip. It s not fair."You give my team not a good feeling. That s not good. Ajax are now in 11th place in the standings and are away at premiership leaders SuperSport United on Saturday.
