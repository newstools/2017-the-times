Briefing parliament's public enterprises portfolio committee yesterday, Brown said SA Express faced profitability and liquidity issues and was unable to pay its debts.Brown, who described SA Express as her "problem child", also reported that the airline was operating with an ageing fleet - four aircraft are grounded - and a high vacancy rate.The airline was expected to pay R150-million to its lenders by February 24, "failing which its government guarantee would be triggered, requiring payment within 30 business days".Brown said SA Express was able to make payment of only R58-million and her department was forced to negotiate payment instalments with Nedbank and Rand Merchant Bank.With four aircraft grounded, the company is also in urgent need of a new fleet but Brown said a Public Finance Management Act application for funding from SA Express had been declined.The company is included in government plans to rationalise airline operations - which include SAA and a 2.5% share in Airlink - in a bid to cut costs.But Brown said this was complicated by the fact that the only airline in the government stable with codeshare - an agreement that two airlines can work the same route - is SAA.
