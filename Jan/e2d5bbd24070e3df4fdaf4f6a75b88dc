Some South Africans have used their Photoshop skills to present the president in female garb - giving Zuma a shawl handbag and headscarf.In another picture he is walking in a tight-fitting dress and wearing a weave."When they want a female president and you want a third term " a picture of a "female Zuma" is worded.In response to the jokers' pictures the president was named the "Gupta's gogo" by a Twitter user.Tweeter Chris Shandu said the female Zuma looked like North-West Premier Thandi Modise.Other responses to the image included laughing emoticons and phrases such "Mzansi has no chill".I'm done with South Africans!
