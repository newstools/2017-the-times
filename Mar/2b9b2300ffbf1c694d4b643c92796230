Faced with a crushing assault on their business model, their response has not been to innovate, change strategy, or improve their service offering.Instead, they have adopted the tactics of a tantrum-throwing toddler, hoping that by stamping their feet and crying loudly enough someone will give in to their demands.Several weeks ago the metered-taxi operators violently attacked Uber drivers and their passengers, and then, on Friday, they blockaded the main highway approaches to ORTambo International Airport.The latter protest caused massive gridlock and caused scores of passengers to miss their flights.Sympathy for their cause went up about as much as a parent's would when faced with a red-faced toddler.If anything, they have probably tipped the scale forever in Uber's favour.One of those caught in the gridlock was Department of Basic Education spokesman Troy Martens, who likely spoke for many when she said: "I can tell you one thing for sure, I will not ever support a metered taxi again. And it has only made me more resolute to use Uber taxis."Even the Gauteng government appears to have cooled dramatically towards the metered-taxi cause as a result of Friday's protest. Ismail Vadi, the transport MEC, made it clear that Uber was here to stay.There is plenty to be critical of when it comes to Uber, such as its treatment of its drivers, or "partners", but it has won the game hands-down in providing an affordable and reliable service to consumers.The metered-taxi industry is heading for the scrapheap unless it can out-innovate its competition or beat them in service.No one is going to turn back the clock, no matter how loud their tantrums.
