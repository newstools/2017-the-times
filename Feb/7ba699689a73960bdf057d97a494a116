Anton Myburgh SC told the Labour Court on Tuesday that the former Bafana Bafana's application is not urgent and that the court should not interfere with Safa's contractual obligations.The former Bafana Bafana coach has approached the court to stop Safa from hiring his replacement before his dismissal challenge at the Commission for Conciliation Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) is finalised.Mashaba was fired as national team coach in December after a disciplinary committee found him guilty of gross misconduct insubordination and violating the communications policy of Safa.This was after the coach's public outburst in November in Polokwane where he had a go at Safa bosses and the media following his side's 2-1 victory over Senegal."He has a right to be reinstated but he has no right to tell us how to conduct our affairs " Myburgh said.He said there would be no "grave" injustice against Mashaba if Safa hired another coach while the CCMA matter was pending."If Safa appoints [Jose] Mourinho and Mashaba is reinstated [by the CCMA] that is not his problem" Myburgh argued."This application comes nowhere near establishing a legal right."Judgment on the application will be delivered next Tuesday.
