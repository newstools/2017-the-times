A similar observation might be made of South Africa as we search for a theme tune that makes sense.The discordant soundtrack of South African politics is obvious but it is no more melodious on the stages of education and culture.The debate about the value of the continued use of Shakespeare's works in South African classrooms is a case in point. So is the Supreme Court of Appeal's decision on Tuesday upholding the University of Free State's decision to use English as its primary medium.But where sanity appears scarce in politics the latter two examples provide a welcome breath of pragmatism - and, perhaps, some hope that all might not be lost at what feels like a crossroads moment for South Africa.Shakespeare, it seems, will not be turfed wholesale from the curriculum, but is likely to be downgraded. There's nothing wrong with this approach, which balances the foundational contribution of the Bard to English literature and language with other works which more accurately reflect our society.Similarly, the decision by UFS to change its language policy from the dual medium of English and Afrikaans to English only practically addresses the reality of its student population.Both these developments comfortably sacrifice blind devotion to "truths" - the infallibility of Shakespeare and the apparent paramountcy of Afrikaans - without the sky falling in.Now, if only such prudence could find its way into political life which is as raw and real as punk rock, but at some point we have to advance beyond struggling with our instruments to producing a tune that is not only harmonious but which everyone will want to hum.
