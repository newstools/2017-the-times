Itunu Ubogu, a mother of three who holds a senior position in the Gauteng health department, knows exactly how it feels.After the letter arrived came another surprise - her salary slip a month later showed a deduction of more than R33,000 towards settling the claimed debt.This was followed by more bad news - her annual bonus would be withheld.Ubogu, who had been CEO of Tshwane District Hospital in Pretoria since 2006, was transferred to Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital as "clinical manager: allied" - but by mistake she was paid the higher salary of a "clinical manager: medical" .It took the department five years to discover their error.A letter was sent to Ubogu in September 2015 explaining that she had been "erroneously appointed".She was told that the amount overpaid to her was R794,000.First she objected to what she claimed was a demotion with the help from her trade union, the Public Servants' Association of SA.Ubogu discovered that the department had deducted R33705 from her salary in a single month last year without her knowledge and consent.No further deductions were made during the next two months, but then she was told that her annual bonus would not be paid to offset her debt.This was the final straw and Ubogu turned for help to the Labour Court in Johannesburg, arguing that current legislation allowing the state to deduct money paid wrongfully to employees was unconstitutional.The health department argued that the remuneration Ubogu received from July 2010 was not due to her because she did not perform the functions for which she had been paid.But Labour Court judge Edwin Tlhotlhalemaje sided with Ubogu and declared as unconstitutional a section of the Public Service Act that allows the state to deduct payments wrongfully made to employees in the absence of any due process or an agreement.The court has now altered part of section 38 of the Public Service Act to conform with the constitution.It now provides for deductions only after an employee has agreed to them, and if there is no agreement, then by way of litigation.It is unclear whether the department will continue in its quest to recover the rest of the money.Ubogu said she did not know whether the department still expected her to pay the rest of the money it says she still owes it.The law firm that represented Ubogu said the effect of the judgment was that the question of the liability of Ubogu, and any repayment plan, would have to be the subject of an agreement or court order, and not a unilateral determination by the state."If the state decides to pursue [this further] we will oppose it," said lawyer Charmane Nel.
