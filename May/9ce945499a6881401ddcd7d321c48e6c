In a strongly worded statement issued on Tuesday Safa have threatened to invoke Article 2.17.18 of the statutes.The rule says the mother body can suspend fine terminate the membership of or otherwise deal with any member local football association club or individual affiliated to them for engaging in acts of misconduct improper practises misdemeanour acts of defiance or for bringing Safa into disrepute. We have received letters from Bidvest Wits and Supersport United in which they have advised certain players against honouring a national call-up " the statement said."The reasons advanced by both Wits and Supersport are ill-advised does not serve the national interest and go against the Safa statutes that clubs are obliged to release the players to the national team. Safa said they will convene an urgent tribunal and seek the immediate suspension of the players in question on Wednesday.The severest penalty will be sought against Wits and Supersport and the two sides could even be suspended. We submit that Wits Supersport and other clubs participating in Safa s competitions leagues and other structures have an obligation to make their players available for national duty as and when needed."Wits s consistent resistance to the call-ups from the national teams runs contrary to these principles."We are quite concerned by Wits s self-serving reference to the U20 Fifa World Cup falling outside an international window and Supersport s insistence that they need players for their remaining fixtures that include the Nedbank Cup and the Caf Confederations Cup."The Fifa World Cup is the number one priority for any country and the national interest takes precedence over anything else."Safa added that in terms of Article 2.17.13 of the their statutes they have the authority to select teams for international and representative matches at all levels and to arrange tours and to sanction matches in and regulate the transfer of players to and from the Republic of South Africa in terms of the Fifa Regulations. Since we are constantly faced with the club v country phenomenon whereas some clubs use every excuse to withhold players from joining the national team set up."We regret to report as we hereby do that the association will be forced to immediately invoke Article 2.17.18 amongst others of the SAFA statutes in pursuit of the objectives stated in Article 2.17.13 of the same statutes."Both teams were not available for comment. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
