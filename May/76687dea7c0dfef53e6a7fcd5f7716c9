Voting by SMS and internet has opened for the preseason game with a format where fans select the line-ups and now the formations.In line with the gimmicky format of the competition that annually fills the FNB Stadium but whose popularity is debatable having replaced the more-favoured four-team Charity Spectacular in 2011 Tuesday's launch at Park Stadium was a glitzy if pointless affair.Former Buccaneers Benni McCarthy ex-Chiefs striker Shaun Bartlett and Marks Maponyane who starred for both teams gave long-winded explanations of the various football formations.Both coaches Steve Komphela of Chiefs and Kjell Jonevret of Pirates spoke but neither had much of value to say about a preseason gimmick that is still four months away and at a time when the serious matter of the current Absa Premiership season is still six weeks from completion. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
