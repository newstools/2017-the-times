Hani, former general secretary of the SACP, was murdered on April 10 1993.The party said "a rogue element" had aimed a gun at Mapaila as he was mounting the stage to speak on behalf of the party at the service in Ekurhuleni, on the East Rand.President Jacob Zuma also spoke at the service ."The gunman aborted his mission after what seemed to be a warning to him that he had been exposed."What was also a factor was that Mapaila had an umbrella because of a heavy rainstorm. This caused a distraction when he ascended the stage.''Mapaila did not deliver his speech.Tensions have been high in the ANC-led tripartite alliance since Zuma 's controversial reshuffling of his cabinet on March 31.The alleged assassination attempt follows killings late last year in Durban that were linked to conflicts between the ANC and the SACP.The SACP said it would report the incident to the police and discuss it with the ANC and its other alliance partner, labour federation Cosatu.
