The TV personality recently celebrated seven years since she burst into the entertainment industry and reflected on how much she has accomplished. "Seven years ago I won the Live Presenter Search, as a young inexperienced girl with so much to learn. I put in 110% into every very deep end I was thrown into," she said. Minnie added that today she has a thriving career and is proud to be hosting two hit shows. "Today I host 2 hit TV shows. The one show is viewed across Africa on SuperSport. I have my own production company. I'm doing my bit to improve impoverished communities and working on strategies to make them self sustainable," she added. Her personal life is also flourishing and she will soon get her fairytale ending when she marries the love of her life. "And then sometime soon I get to say 'I do' to the love of my life I still dream bigger &amp; bigger each day," she said. Minnie's bae Quinton Jones popped the question in December and insiders told TshisaLIVE few days ago that she is in "full planning mode" ahead of their big day. "Minnie has taken charge of the planning. She is very involved. She's not the kind of bride that is just going to have someone do everything. This is her big day and she wants to have personal touches on everything," said a source.We can't wait to see pics!
