After a disappointing night for the Wololo hitmaker, both Babes and Mampintsha could not hold back their anger and frustrations.Babes took to social to vent over not winning any awards for her music. She said that she "refuses to believe" that her song can be played and trend as it did but not receive any award.She added that she is being recognised by international brands such as BET but failing to win even one award in SA is bizzare."Everyone saw what happened at the Metros has happened at the SAMAs. These awards are sold. Continue buying the awards. But it's fine, we won't starve. I will always be Babes Wodumo and Mampintsha will remain Mampintsha," Babes said.Babes Wodumo has given up on 'em awards. #SAMA23 pic.twitter.com/BLmoNSIhbiHe accused them of being jealous.
