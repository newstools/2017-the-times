Riky and the Major League twins have always been close but the duo have remained silent about their future, after Riky's shock resignation announcement on Monday. EFF leader Julius Malema seemed to stoke the fire when he tweeted, just a few hours later, that he had advised both Riky and Major League against joining the record label.Despite the drama surrounding the record label, the duo said that they were still a part of Mabala Noise and had no plans to leave."Our relationship with the label is the same as it has always been and has not changed since Riky's departure," the group's Banele told TshisaLIVE.Mabala Noise spokesperson Mhlo Gumede also shut down any suggestion that the group's future at the label was in doubt."They (Major League) are still an important part of Mabala Noise and we know nothing about the rumours of them leaving," Mhlo told TshisaLIVE.
