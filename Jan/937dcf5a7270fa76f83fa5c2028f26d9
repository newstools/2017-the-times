We have received a copy of a letter that was addressed to Arrows and in that letter we have not been asked to act at all " Mumble said."They are seeking clarification from Arrows on the alleged incident."It is difficult for me to comment on an issue that I don t have full details on but we don t promote serious things where people are threatened with guns."If this incident indeed happened we condemn it in the strongest possible terms. Arrows chairperson and PSL CEO Mato Madlala insisted that Miheso was not forced to sign a contract against his will."No one was forced to sign a contract and I don't want to say much about this issue " Madlala said."There is more information on our social media."While Safpu said Miheso confirmed the incident to them Arrows posted a handwritten letter on their website saying it was signed by the player and he said he was not forced to sign the contract. This is to state my disappointment on the news claiming that you had me threatened " reads the letter."This is all incorrect in fact I am grateful to you and everything you have done for me."The termination agreement I signed is correct and I was not forced to sign it."I did this willingly and I have been paid everything due to me."I wish to state my apologies for everything.Gaoshubelwe insisted that the player said he was forced to sign the contract. I am in constant contact with the player and the last time I spoke to him was on Thursday " Gaoshubelwe."He confirmed to me that he was forced to sign a contract and I believe he is talking the truth."We want Safa to give a firm commitment and timeline that they will investigate this matter."If they don t have the capacity or the will to investigate the matter we will have no choice but to seek help from Fifa. Safa are the custodians of football in the country and they must act when things like this happen because it has international relations implications."The problem we are facing in our football is that you have a painful situation where a CEO (Madlala) of a club who occupies a similar position at the PSL which in this case has led to a contradicted stability. - TMG Digital
