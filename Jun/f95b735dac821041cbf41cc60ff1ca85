Coach Mcdonald Makhubedu led his players with slick dance moves while Buya Msuthu players left the field in tears as their chance of gaining National First Division was shattered by Acornbush.What the Mpumalanga champions did not count on was dark horses Super Eagles of Free State beating Buya Msuthu 3-1 in their ABC Motsepe playoffs last group game on Friday.The win meant Eagles grabbed one of the two NFD spots while Uthongathi of Kwazulu-Natal are expected to beat Mainstay United and play gain NFD promotion.Mathematically EC Bees and Zizwe United still stand a chance of making it to the NFD but for that to happen Mainstay would have to cause an upset and beat Uthongathi which is very unlikely.Acornbush needed Buya Msuthu to avoid defeat against Eagles but their body language during the warm up showed they were a team playing just to honour the fixture.Buya Msuthu had nothing to play for with their players electing to showboat while Acornbush watched helplessly.Eagles are now the only team in the Free State in the NFD. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
