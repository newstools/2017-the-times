The cells that make hairs and turn them grey were accidentally discovered by US scientists as they explored how certain cancer tumours form.The breakthrough could one day identify possible treatments for balding and hair greying, and also explain why we age.Associate Professor of Dermatology Lu Le at UT Southwestern Medical Centre said: "Although this project was started in an effort to understand how tumours form, we ended up learning why hair turns grey and discovering the identity of the cell that directly gives rise to hair."We hope to create a topical compound or to safely deliver the necessary gene to hair follicles to correct these problems."The study found the protein, called KROX20, which is more commonly associated with nerve development, turns on in skin cells that become the hair shaft.Hair precursor, or progenitor, cells then produce a protein called stem cell factor, or SCF , which is essential for hair pigmentation.When scientists deleted the SCF gene in the hair progenitor cells in mice, their hair turned white.When they deleted the KROX20-producing cells, no hair grew and the mice became bald.Le made the discovery while studying neurofibromatosis type 1, a genetic disease that causes tumours to grow on nerves.Scientists already knew stem cells contained in hair follicles are involved in making hair and that SCF is important for pigmented cells. What they did not know was what happens after those stem cells move down to the base, or bulb, of hair follicles, and which cells in the hair follicles produce SCF, or that cells involved in hair-shaft creation make the KROX20 protein.Future research will try to determine if the KROX20 in cells and the SCF gene stop working properly as people age, leading to the greying and hair thinning, as well as in male pattern baldness.
