Papa Penny not only offers entertainment on his reality show, but also regularly gives viewers a new perspective on things. And, this week Papa Penny introduced fans to a new way to cool down when the heat goes through the roof in Limpopo. Papa Penny's genius vocabulary gave new meaning to the traditional XiTsonga dance, which women use Xibelani (layered skirt for dancing) to do.  The women wear these skirts around their waists and sway from left to right. According to Papa Penny all people needed to conquer the blazing summer days was to have a bunch of women dance around them in their Xebelanis, which would serve as air conditioning. Papa Penny called the dance "air conditioning" and Twitter went crazy in memes! Twitter also couldn't help but praise Papa Penny for his "no fear approach" when negotiating prices. The Tsonga music icon wanted to buy a cow but was not willing to pay the full price which was over R10,000. Instead, Papa Panny wanted the price to be cut down by 50%... and he was willing to talk his way out of the original price... in English. Twitter was left in stitches and so was the farm owner.
