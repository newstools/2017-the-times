Pirates are United's next league opponents at Orlando Stadium on Tuesday night and Baxter was glued to his television screen trying to analyse their work under new coach Kjell Jonevret.Baxter made time to watch Chiefs against Pirates despite the fact that United were just about to take on Ajax Cape Town at Lucas Moripe Stadium in Atteridgeville, which ended in a goalless draw, a few hours later."Yes, I managed to watch the whole match. They got on top early and opened very well; it is probably against the run of play that Kaizer Chiefs scored," Baxter said."Having failed to win, they will be looking to do that against us and I am sure that it will be a good game.""All matches are big in the PSL. Pirates have just played against Cape Town City and Chiefs where they did not get the required results and I am sure that they will be looking to get back to winning ways against us."I expect a response from my players from this match against Ajax. "We have to bring our 'A game' to the party or otherwise their desire to get back on track will overpower us."Looking back at the draw against Ajax, which cost them an opportunity to go to the top of the Absa Premiership standings, Baxter admitted that he had been quite disappointed with the result and with the performance of his players.
