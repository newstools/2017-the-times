The 34-year-old was offered to City as a free agent after he left Greek side Panathinaikos late last year following the mutual termination of his contract with the club. We were offered Essien and we did look at the deal quite closely, with regards to what he could bring to our current squad, but in the end we decided against it, City owner John Comitis reveals. Once we weighed up everything, it was just not the right move for us. City did announce the signings of winger Letsie Koapeng and midfielder Siyabonga Dubula on Tuesday, but says unless something extraordinary happens, they are done for the night with the window to slam shut at midnight. We don t foresee any more business tonight, but that does not mean that we are not still looking to add to the squad in February, Comitis said. We still have two foreign slots open and there are a lot of quality free agents out there. We will look at them and what they can bring to the squad, and if it works for both parties then we will sign them. The signing of Essien would have been a major PR coup for the fledgling club, who have stunned the PSL this season having only been formed in June last year.They are currently top of the league and claimed the Telkom Knockout title last month.Essien was a stand-out player for Bastia and Lyon in France before joining Chelsea in 2005. He spent eight years at Stamford Bridge, including one season on loan at Real Madrid, before leaving for AC Milan.A player with that history at City would have shone the spotlight more on the club. - TMG Digital
