 We are deeply concerned by the inflammatory language used by people professing to speak on behalf of the ANC Youth League and the MK Military Veterans Association who say they are acting in defence of Zuma. Their calls for violence their attacks on protesters and their illegal wearing of military uniforms must be condemned and there must be pressure on the ANC to ensure its supporters are able to show the same levels of discipline as those exercising their right to peaceful protest Save South Africa said on Sunday. It s a tragic irony that the ANC played such a leading role in fighting for the freedoms we enjoy today and in shaping the Constitution that protects the rights of South Africans to take part in peaceful protest -- and yet some of those who profess to act in its name show such a fundamental disregard for that same Constitution the campaign added.It thanked the tens of thousands of people who took to the streets on 7 April to say loudly and clearly: Zuma Must Go! Our protests in Pretoria Cape Town and Port Elizabeth drew massive crowds and sent a clear message that civil society is sick and tired of his misrule and that he must get out of office. We also pay tribute to those who organised their own protests in cities and towns such as we Cradock Prince Albert King William s Town and Bloemfontein. The campaign said it was particularly pleased that the protests took place peacefully and that no one was hurt. This augurs well for the growing number of protests planned as we move towards 18 April when Parliament will debate the ninth vote of no confidence in Zuma and we are very encouraged by the number of organisations who have expressed support for future rolling mass action. It also thanked law enforcement agencies for their efficient handling of the logistics around the protests and for ensuring that South Africans were able to make their voices heard in safety.
