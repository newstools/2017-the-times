In a debate at the Western Cape provincial legislature the DA s Lorraine Botha said the Social Development Minister and the ANC-led government had proved they do not care about the poor. [Dlamini] has shown the middle finger to the Constitutional Court judgement of 2014. She has shown that to her it is not that important whether the poorest of the poor do not have their only income come the 1st of April 2017 said Botha.Finance MEC Ivan Meyer said the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) crisis began on the day President Jacob Zuma appointed Dlamini.And his cabinet colleague Health MEC Nomafrench Mbombo asked how grandparents were going to feed their grandchildren if grants were not paid from April 1. Some of them are sick ... how are they going to take their medication without food? How are they going to send their children to school hungry? she said.The ANC hit back with MPL Pholisa Makeleni saying Sassa had reliably ensured that Western Cape recipients were paid their grants. There is no evidence that suggests beneficiaries [will be] adversely affected. This is [just a] hypothesis... which cannot be proven since the event has not happened she said.Maurencia Gillion who is also ANC treasurer in province said the party cared about vulnerable people and children who depend on social grants. This government under the ANC undertook to make sure that all beneficiaries will be paid on time as it has happened as many times since 1994 she said.She said the DA was stoking fear and panic that beneficiaries would not be paid their grants. If the DA cared its members would now all be working really hard in warehouses and stores to make up 17 million grocery hampers to distribute before the first of April to those poor people who they believe will not get grants she said. - TMG Digital/The Times
