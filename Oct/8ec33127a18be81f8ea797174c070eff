President Jacob Zuma reshuffled his cabinet this week after meeting a delegation from the Russian government. The Sunday Times can reveal that a high-level Russian team met Zuma on Monday just before he told the ANC top six about his decision to make changes to his cabinet. Government insiders said the group came to the country to warn Zuma’s administration  to implement the R1-trillion new  nuclear build project. Following the meeting,  Zuma announced the removal of Nkhensani Kubayi from the energy portfolio to the communications ministry. She was replaced by former state security minister David Mahlobo,  who was trained in Russia before taking up the intelligence post in 2014. Other changes included the dismissal of SACP boss Blade Nzimande from higher education. Nzimande was replaced by former home affairs minister Hlengiwe Mkhize. Ayanda Dloldo replaced Mkhize at home affairs. • Read the full story on the Sunday Times website
