The trend of flaunting hard cash on social media seems to have made its way into a South African prison cell. The Department of Correctional Services is currently investigating a security breach after a video showing an inmate counting money inside a cell went viral. In the video‚ the inmate can be heard saying the R100 bank notes amount to R2‚700. “Nna ke ja nyuku. A ke dlale‚” the inmate can be heard saying in Sotho‚ which loosely translated means: “I make money. I don’t play games.” This is the latest money flaunting stunt to hit the internet after images of traffic officials and two actresses pretending to be eating a stack of money went viral. Correctional Services spokesman in Gauteng Ofentse Morwane said: “The department has noted with concern the video footage doing rounds on social media [showing] an offender counting money in a cell.” He said the inmate was identified and had been removed from a communal cell to a single cell while investigations continue.
