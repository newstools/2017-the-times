The appeal came after the Harare High Court granted Mawarire bail and ordered that he be released on Thursday. Mawarire was arrested on his return to Zimbabwe last week and charged with subversion and insulting the national Flag of Zimbabwe in connection with protests he led in 2016 over corruption and economic decline. Pastor Evan Mawarire is being subjected to political persecution through the courts for exercising his freedom of expression. His continued persecution has a chilling effect on peaceful activism in Zimbabwe said Muleya Mwananyanda Amnesty International s Deputy Director for Southern Africa. The release of Pastor Evan Mawarire on bail is not enough the politically motivated charges against him must be completely withdrawn. The state cannot continue to harass and intimidate him simply for standing up for human rights. The two organisations called on the Zimbabwean government to stop punishing those who seek to hold their government accountable. No one should be put behind bars for asking difficult questions about the governance of the country. Instead of listening to them the government is subjecting people like Pastor Evan Mawarire to trumped-up criminal investigations said David Kode Senior Policy and Research Officer at Civicus. The actions of the state go against the principles of justice and demonstrate a systematic targeting of those who dare to hold the government to account.
