Speaking after a two-day national leadership meeting secretary general Njabulo Nzuza said the ANCYL viewed the policy documents of the ruling party as seeking to move the organisation from a leftist position which pursues the interest of the working class towards the right where it embraces capitalist views.He said the league is against the shift in position by the ruling party. The ANC should remain and never move away from its course of committing more to the working class and the poor. The ANCYL is of the view that as the ANC we must advance for the expropriation of land without compensation. This is informed by the fact that the frustrations of the poor of this country started when they were dispossessed of their land which was their wealth. The ANCYL noted that the strategy and tactic document seems to be shy on the issue of white monopoly capital but emphasises monopoly capital and not white monopoly capital. The ANCYL believes that this is a right wing departure from the movement s historic perspective that the system of accumulation and ownership in South Africa has always been fundamentally white Nzuza said.He added that the league would not support any system that seeks to cast away the black majority and restricting them to lowly remunerated stock of cheap labour and consumer base for the output of white monopoly controlled economic output . We therefore declare white monopoly capital as the enemy of the national democratic revolution. He said the ANCYL would champion policies that seek to scrap experience as a requirement for entry level positions in the workplace.The ANC will hold its policy conference later this month to discuss among other issues transformation and whether its current policies have been able to address the legacy of the apartheid era.
