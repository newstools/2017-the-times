Rabada was in prime form in the second test where his 10-wicket haul propelled the Proteas to a 282-run win against Sri Lanka sealing the series win in the process. Kagiso Rabada is a player with an excellent future ahead of him and he needs to be managed properly " said Holding who was the keynote speaker at Wednesday evening's annual Western Province Cricket Club's New Year's address."He's enthusiastic he's athletic."He can run in and bowl fast all day but we know you can't do that the whole day."You have to make sure that you manage him because he can't manage himself. He's not going to limit himself and you hope there will be someone who will limit him."If he's going to last for 14-15 years he can't bowl 25-30 overs in a day on a regular basis."He'll want to do it but he needs to be told it's ok to say no and not bowl regularly. While cooler conditions on day four allowed for Rabada to bowl the most overs in the attack especially in the second innings Kyle Abbott's impending departure to Hampshire and other factors like Dale Steyn's injury means 21-year-old needs to be monitored and managed very closely.Steyn is only likely to make a comeback from his broken shoulder in June while Morne Morkel has struggled with fitness after a back injury that has kept him out of action for nearly a year.Probably fuelled by the exuberance of youth Rabada was not quite enamoured by the need to rest when the sun is shining for him to make hay.He is aware of how important he is to the South African cause in the light of his senior fast bowlers having to look after their bodies. I think resting is when you've got time off and when you've got time off that's when you should be resting " Rabada said."When you need to bowl is when you need to bowl because you have to get yourself at the highest level. It's a broad topic but I guess it comes with experience and knowing yourself because you'll know how to rest and control your rest."In time and with experience you know when you need to rest."If its recommended then you have to be open-minded about it because the people who inform you are not employed for no reason."You have to respect their opinions."You have to take their advice but it's also about how you feel. - TMG Digital
