The Mi Casa singer has come up with a plan on how he plans to tackle negativity this year, and was kind enough to share that plan with fans.J said that this year he is all about positivity and intends to remind himself of that when negativity is thrown into his life."This year all I am after is positivity. Spending time with myself. Reminding myself to have a positive outlook on life and its dealings. Funny thing is the more positive you want to be the more negativity comes your way."J believed that maybe negative curve balls are all part of a plan to be more prepared in future."I believe this is Gods way of training me. How do you or I become more positive if you are not thrown negative? So next time you trying to have a positive outlook on something and are struggling to find it, remember that, that negativity is there to train you to become more positive."Thanks for sharing J!
