The King of Midmar as he has been dubbed will be competing against Dutchman Ferry Weertman who took gold in the 10km open water swim at the Rio Olympics last year. Ho finished just 5 seconds behind him but still placed 10th. But come hell or high water 26-year-old Ho is determined to maintain his unbeaten run. It will be a great honour for me to race him said Ho. We know each other and we are friends. Midmar is my home ground and he doesn t know what to expect as it is his first time. The competition first held in 1974 is the world s largest competitive open water event. It comprises eight races over a two day period. Ho said he had been struggling with illness over the last few weeks but was training through it.Asked if he is aiming for 10 he said although ten is an ultimate goal he prefers to take it year by year. Let s see what happens let s get to number eight first. And he would prefer the dam to be a little choppy . I m not a great fan of completely flat; I don t see it as a true test. Then again we don t want it so rough that it impacts on performance. Somewhere in the middle would be best. At the 2015 FINA World Championships Ho became the first South African to win gold in the men s five-kilometre open water event.This year the Midmar Mile takes place on February 11 and 12. - TMG Digital/TimesLIVE
