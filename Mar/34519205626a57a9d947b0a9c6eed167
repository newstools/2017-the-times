Wally said on Friday he had given formal notice on Thursday night.He is following former Mango chief executive Nico Bezuidenhout who left in July last year to head up the Fasthjet. Wally said had served on the board of Mango for 10 years including three terms as chairman. It was time to move on and I had a number of options he said. Fastjet is London listed; it gives me tremendous exposure in that market so I took this option. Mango is a subsidiary of South African Airways (SAA) and is facing the prospect of restructuring or a merger with its parent airline along with SA Express. Mango posted a R37 million loss in the 2015-16 financial year a reversal from the R38m profit in the previous financial year. Wally downplayed this saying the airline was still well-positioned. They will just need to adjust and think how best to utilise their assets he said.
