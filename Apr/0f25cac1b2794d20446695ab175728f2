The veteran actor, who has been in the industry for more than a decade, has become somewhat of an 'authoritative figure' in the acting world.He has also learnt many invaluable lessons, which he has decided to share with young actors.So if you have aspirations of cracking into the industry, best you grab a notebook!#Actors RULE 1: Be professional.#Actors RULE 2: Don't let fame get to your head. NO ACTOR IS BIGGER THAN A SHOW. The show will go on.#Actors RULE 3: Be careful of the image u sell on social media. Otherwise audiences struggle to connect with the characters you portray#Actors RULE 4: Respect the crew. These are the people producers get references from.#Actors RULE 5: Your contract is with the producer. Not the broadcaster. Don't cross the line.#Actors RULE 6: RESPECT the writers. Again.... RESPECT THE WRITERS!
