Johannesburg Water spokesperson Tidimalo Chuene said on Friday that notices relating to targeted water restrictions had been issued through radio and newspaper adverts at community meetings and on its website and social media accounts as early as September. Is your suburb affected by water cuts? Check this listResidents in the Deep South Midrand Sandton Soweto Central and Randburg areas experienced the latest wave of water shedding on Thursday between 8pm and 4am.No water will be released from reservoirs in these areas during this time period. The water cuts will be carried out every night indefinitely as the municipality attempts to reach the water restriction target set by the Department of Water and Sanitation.These areas have been targeted because of the high levels of water consumption.Some took to social media to complain in light of recent rainfall. Don't believe this for a moment. The dams are 200% fuller than early December and now we have massive restrictions Rob Scott posted on Facebook.Johannesburg Water reminded the city's residents that level two water restrictions are still in place despite recent rainfall because "water levels at the Integrated Vaal River system have not risen sufficiently to above satisfactory levels".The Department of Water and Sanitation said earlier this month that it may consider lifting water restrictions in Gauteng when the Vaal River system made up of 14 dams is at least 70% full. This week the Vaal Major water management area was 67.8% full.Johannesburg Water said it has successfully curbed water usage in Lenasia Northcliff Fairlands and Blackheath when consumption was excessive in November using the water shedding approach.It suggested that those affected store water for use in the morning because it may take five to six hours for water flow to be restored to taps after reservoir valves are reopened at 4am.The water supply cuts are implemented overnight to reduce inconvenience caused to residents in the affected areas Chuene said. People are sleeping and there less inconvenience to them and hopefully more rapid build-up of [water] supplies to cater for early morning rush activities. The Johannesburg Metro Police Department is monitoring wasteful water use and has so far issued 665 fines to consumers.
